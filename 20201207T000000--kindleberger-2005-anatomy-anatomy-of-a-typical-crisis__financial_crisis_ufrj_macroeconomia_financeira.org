* Specifics comments
** The model

- Minskian pro-cyclical changes in *credit suply* $\Rightarrow$ Banks are more cautios $\Rightarrow$ Financial Fragility $\Rightarrow$ Financial crisis (single country)
  + Investors more optimistic during boom
    - Estimates higher profitability
    - More eager to borrow
    - At least one sector of the economy increases
      + Follow-the-leader process
    - Higher *profit-share*
  + Less optimistic during economic downturn
  + Fisher and the great relevance of *highly indebted investors*
- Boom is triggered by *expansion of credit*
  + Structuralist view of supply of banking credit
  + Growth rate of banking supply is unstable
  + Banks lend to not loose market-share
- *Policy issue:* Control of both bank and non-bank suppliers of credit
- *Classical economists:* Overtrading  as speculation about increases in the prices of assets or commodities $\Leftrightarrow$ overstimate of prospective returns
  + *Speculation:* Buying commodities for its antecipating capital gain and not for its usefullness
** International propagation 

Kindleberger summarizes international propagation as

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
One conduit from a shock in one country to its impacts in other countries is arbitrage which ensures that the changes in the price of a commodity in one national market will lead to comparable changes in the prices of the more or less identical commodity in other national markets.
#+END_QUOTE

Next, presents some other channels:

- Imports increase as a result of domestic euphoria
- Capital flows
- Currency value changes
- "Psychological connections"
- Credit supply increase in one country would not be offset by the decrease in other countries
- There is no international lender os last resort
** The validity of the model

In this section, the author presents some cirticisms to Minky's model

1. Each crisis is unique $\nRightarrow$ generalization is irrelevant
2. No longer relevant due to changes in business and economic environment
   a. Instability in credit supply is no longer relevant due to structural changes
      - Rise of corporation
      - Emergence of big labor unions
      - Big government
      - Modern banking
        Faster communications
3. Asset price bubbles are improbable since *all information is in the price*
