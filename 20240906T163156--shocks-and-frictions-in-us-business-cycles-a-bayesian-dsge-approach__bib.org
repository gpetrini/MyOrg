** Methodology


- *Sample:*
- *Model:*
- *Variables:*
- *Shocks:*
- *Validation:* The model is validated by contrasting the out-of-sample forecast performance of the model with different econometric estimations, such as *unconstrained* VAR(1), VAR(q), and BVAR(4) over different forecast horizons
  - This evaluation consider the marginal likelihood
  - The estimation uses a pre-training data set
  - In addition, the authors also evaluate the relevance of the frictions of the model
