  abstract = {Demographic and institutional elements, as important drivers of the housing market, should not be neglected because it is not only financial and monetary elements that matter in the case of the housing market. In this context, one relationship, which still remains unclear, is the relationship between the housing and the labour markets. Some research has been undertaken to support the hypothesis that high rates of homeownership lead to high unemployment via increases in the reservation wage. However, further research is needed to address the possible implications of the institutional settings of the labour market in the dynamics of the housing market. The aim of this paper is to bring some light on the link between both markets. In particular, this contribution explains how the housing cycle could be ``amplified'' via a new channel, that is, economic precariousness, which is closely related to job insecurity. Subsequently, we provide evidence in the case of five developed economies, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, over the period 1985\textendash 2013.},

  abstract = {Over two dozen different terms for identification appear in the econometrics literature, including set identification, causal identification, local identification, generic identification, weak identification, identification at infinity, and many more. This survey (i) gives a new framework unifying existing definitions of point identification; (ii) summarizes and compares the zooful of different terms associated with identification that appear in the literature; and (iii) discusses concepts closely related to identification, such as normalizations and the differences in identification between structural models and causal, reduced form models.},
