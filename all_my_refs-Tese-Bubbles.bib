  abstract = {Several Kaleckian models are set out. Harrod- and Domar-style investment functions are specified, and combined with distributive dynamics to generate Goodwin-style cycles. A counterclockwise cycle in a two-dimensional phase diagram for capacity utilization and the wage share is based on long-run profit-led demand and a profit squeeze at high activity levels, consistent with Domar. Harrod-style investment and short-run wage-led demand generate counterfactual clockwise cycles. Financial dynamics involving the equity valuation ratio are considered. Both the ratio and equity price inflation demonstrate positive own-feedback. The ratio can be stabilized cyclically by capital stock growth and/or rising household net worth or debt. Debt accumulation persists (or `overshoots') after equity price inflation switches to a negative rate. A Minsky-style model with Harrodian investment can be stabilized by accumulation of business debt.},

  abstract = {Recognising the rapid increase in housing prices and the presence of socio-economic and demographic disparities that often characterise a metropolitan city, we adopted a sub-city approach and deployed an array of methods to detect bubbles in the different regions of Greater Sydney \textendash{} western, inner-west, southern, eastern and northern \textendash{} over 1991 to 2016, using Westerlund error correction-based panel cointegration, backward supremum augmented Dickey\textendash Fuller (BSADF) procedure, and dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) tests. Our cointegration results show no evidence of cointegration between real house price and rent in the western region. However, there is strong evidence of cointegration in the eastern and northern regions. This confirms the existence of housing submarkets in Greater Sydney, and an indication of housing price bubbles in Western Sydney. Further, the formal BSADF bubble tests reveal strong evidence of explosive price bubbles in Western Sydney, while there is no comparable evidence for the other regions of Sydney, which further highlights the importance of submarket analysis. Importantly, the DOLS results suggest that housing investment plays a major role in the build-up of housing bubbles in Western Sydney, supporting Shiller's Psychological Theory of bubbles which posits that bubbles occur via the speculative behaviour of investors. The implications of the findings are also discussed.},

It uses unique survey data to analyze spatial differences in the imbalance between these two measures in boom and bust markets of the 2000s. We find evidence of higher overall imbalance and its inter-ZIP code area dispersion in the booming years. Buyer search intensity diminishes the imbalance in boom and intensifies it in bust. Other revealed significant covariates have different effects under the two market conditions. Our model explains the liquidity imbalance variations on the ZIP code area level well, but not on the individual property level, highlighting the importance of regional idiosyncratic transaction dynamics.},

Empirical work in this area concentrates primarily on indeterminacies in price levels, exchange rates, and equity prices. We first examine a particular type of explosive indeterminacy, usually called a rational bubble, in an example of the market for equities. Then, we consider empirical work relating to price-level and exchange-rate indeterminacies and empirical studies of indeterminacies in stock prices. Finally, we take up some interpretive issues.},

Standard tests using 27 years of national-level data do not find evidence of cointegration. However, standard tests for cointegration have low power, especially in small samples. I use panel-data tests for cointegration that are more powerful than their time-series counterparts to test for cointegration in a panel of 95 metro areas over 23 years. Using a bootstrap approach to allow for cross-correlations in city-level house-price shocks, I show that even these more powerful tests do not reject the hypothesis of no cointegration. Thus the error-correction specification for house prices and income commonly found in the literature may be inappropriate.},

  abstract = {Before economists relegate a speculative event to the inexplicable or bubble category, we must exhaust all reasonable economic explanations. Among the "reasonable" or "market fundamental" explanations I would include the perception of an increased probability of large returns. The perception might be triggered by genuine economic good news, by a convincing new economic theory about payoffs, or by a fraud launched by insiders acting strategically to trick investors. It might also be triggered by uninformed market participants correctly inferring changes in the distribution of dividends by observing price movements generated by the trading of informed insiders. While some of these perceptions might in the end prove erroneous, movements in asset prices based on them are fundamental and not bubble movements. I aim in these pages to propose market fundamental explanations for the three most famous bubbles: the Dutch tulipmania (1634-37), the Mississippi Bubble (1719-20), and the closely connected South Sea Bubble (1720). Though several authors have proposed market fundamental explanations for the well-documented Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles, these episodes are still treated in the modern literature as outbursts of irrationality.},

An open problem is to determine in real time whether or not a given asset's price process exhibits a bubble. Due to recent progress in the characterization of asset price bubbles using the arbitrage-free martingale pricing technology, we are able to propose a new methodology for answering this question based on the asset's price volatility. We limit ourselves to the special case of a risky asset's price being modeled by a Brownian driven stochastic differential equation. Such models are ubiquitous both in theory and in practice. Our methods use sophisticated volatility estimation techniques combined with the method of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We illustrate these techniques using several stocks from the alleged Internet dot-com episode of 1998\textendash 2001, where price bubbles were widely thought to have existed. Our results confirm the suspicions of the presence of bubbles in many of the dot-com stocks of 1998\textendash 2001.},

  abstract = {Using the Michigan Survey, I show that consumers' house price expectations depend upon the recent history of house price developments in their city of residence. Forecast errors are predictable: people systematically under-estimate momentum and neglect mean reversion, remaining over-optimistic for several quarters after a prolonged trend of house price growth, and vice versa. Housing appreciation also increases the share of consumers who believe real estate is a good investment. Combining loan-level data from Freddie Mac to regional measures of housing sentiment, I show that an exogenous shift in house price expectations leads to an increase in leverage on new mortgage originations. The effect is concentrated on investment properties and among prime borrowers in non-recourse states. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved},

  abstract = {To promote the financial stability, there is a need for an early warning system to signal the formation of asset price misalignments. This research provides two novel methods to accomplish this task. Results in this research shows that the conventional unit root tests in modified forms can be used to construct early warning indicators for bubbles in financial markets. More precisely, the conventional augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test is shown to provide a basis for two novel bubble indicators. These new indicators are tested via MC simulations to analyze their ability to signal emerging unit roots in time series and to compare their power with standard stability and unit root tests. Simulation results concerning these two new stability tests are promising: they seem to be more robust and to have more power in the presence of changing persistence than the standard stability and unit root tests. When these new tests are applied to real US stock market data starting from 1871, they are able to signal most of the consensus bubbles, defined as stock market booms for example by the IMF, and they also flash warning signals far ahead of a crash. Also encouraging are the results with these methods in practical applications using equity prices in the UK, Finland and China as the methods seem to be able to signal most of the consensus bubbles from the data. Finally, these early warning indicators are applied to data for several housing markets. In most of the cases the indicators seem to work relatively well, indicating bubbles before the periods which, according to the consensus literature, are seen as periods of sizeable upward or downward movements. The scope of application of these early warning indicators could be wide. They could be used eg to help determine the right timing for the start of a monetary tightening cycle or for an increase in countercyclical capital buffers.},

  abstract = {Bubbles and crashes have long been an important area of research that has not yet led to a comprehensive theoretical or empirical understanding of how to define, measure, and compare such extreme market events. Highlights of the vast literature on bubbles, crashes, and volatility are surveyed and a promising direction for future research, based on a theory of short-side rationing, is described. The theory suggests that, especially in extreme market conditions, marginal quantities held or not held become transactionally more important than the prices paid or received. Our approach is empirically implemented by fitting monthly elasticity of return variances to an exponential expression. From this follows a comparison of changes in implied versus realized volatility, generation of an extreme events line (EEL), and a crash intensity comparison metric. These methods open a new perspective from which it is possible to analyze bubble and crash events as applied to different time scales and asset classes that include bonds, real estate, foreign exchange, and commodities.},

A basic framework is proposed which takes account of Japan's so-called land bubble by incorporating the interaction of land with the banking sector in a macroeconomic portfolio model of capital flows. Empirical evidence is supportive of the hypothesis that land-related bank loans have been a major determinant of Japanese net long-term foreign investment. the hypothesis of substitution between direct and indirect foreign investment also receives support, and areas of future research are mentioned.},

  abstract = {During the course of the 1980s three major 'anomalies' were observed in a number of countries, including in Japan, which threw doubt on the traditional macroeconomic models: 1. The apparent velocity decline in the quantity equation and the resulting instability of the money demand function; 2. unusually fast rises in asset prices that often came to be referred to as speculative bubbles and which could not be explained by standard asset pricing models; and 3. capital exports from Japan, which reached historic proportions in the mid-1980s, but collapsed in the early 1990s, and which could not be explained by traditional models. In this article I present a simple model that encompasses the standard theory as a special case and which simultaneously can account for the above three 'anomalies'. It is based on a 'quantity equation' of credit creation, which is disaggregated into credit for 'financial circulation' and credit for the 'real circulation'. It is shown that excessive credit creation for financial circulation is responsible for all three 'anomalies'. The model is supported in empirical tests using the general to specific econometric methodology and using Japanese data. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for monetary theory, future research and economic policy.},

As such, this paper falls into the body of research on banking crises, recent works within which include Caprio and Klingebiel (1996), Caprio et al. (2005), Demirg\"u\c{c}-Kunt and Detragiache (2005), Werner (2005), Beck et al. (2006), and Reinhart and Rogoff (2008). Secondly, I aim to gain insights into the link between the banking sector and the economy (which are again of importance for both theory and policy). This is an important topic that has slowly but steadily grown to a substantial body of literature. Many authors recognise that banks are `special' in some way (Fama, 1985, Bossone, 1999, James and Smith, 2000, Ashcraft, 2005), and that the link between the banking sector and the economy is of great importance (King and Levine, 1996, Levine, 1997). However, the precise details of just what makes banks special, as well as the precise nature of their link to the economy have remained unclear or at least disputed. Analysing crises may help elucidate these issues.},

  abstract = {The financial crisis has triggered a new consensus among economists that it is necessary to include a banking sector in macroeconomic models. It is also necessary for the finance and banking literature to consider how best to incorporate systemic, macroeconomic feedbacks into its modelling of financial intermediation. Thus a new research programme on the link between banking and the economy is needed. This special issue is devoted to this theme. In this paper an overview of the issues and problems in the economics and finance literature is presented, and a concrete, simple approach is identified of how to incorporate banks into a macroeconomic model that solves many of these issues. The model distinguishes between the type of credit that boosts GDP and credit that is associated with asset prices and banking crises. The model is consistent with the empirical record. Some applications are discussed, namely the prediction and prevention of banking crises, implications for fiscal policy, and a solution to the European sovereign debt crisis that stimulates growth while avoiding the corner solutions of euro exit or fiscal union.},
