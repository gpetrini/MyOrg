  abstract = {Taking into account the pull-push debate on the weight that external or internal factors have on the behavior of capital flows and country-risk premium of developing economies, the aim of this article is to assess empirically the extent by which the push factors, linked to global liquidity and interest rates, (compared to country-specific factors) play on the changes in the risk premium of a set of countries of the periphery, in the period 1999-2019. This is done using the methodology of Principal Component Analysis, which can relate the information from different countries to its common sources. We also test for a structural change in the premium risk series in 2003, by means of structural break tests. We find that push factors do play the predominant role in explaining country risk changes of our selected peripherical countries and that there was indeed a substantial general reduction in country risk premia after 2003, confirming that the external constraints of the periphery were significantly loosened by more favorable conditions in the international economy in the more recent period. The results are in line both with the view that cycles in peripherical economies are broadly subordinated to global financial cycles, in but also that such external conditions substantially improved compared to the 1990s.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces heterogeneous microeconomic behavior into a demand-driven stock-flow consistent model with endogenous credit creation, so as to study the joint dynamics of both the personal and the functional distribution of income, household debt and aggregate demand. The distinctive feature is in that the aggregation of heterogeneous agents is not performed numerically as in traditional agent-based models, but by means of an innovative analytical methodology, originally developed in statistical mechanics and recently imported into macroeconomics. Numerical and analytical results reveal that while boosting aggregate demand, a raise in the minimum wage and a reduction in wage inequality can also lead the economy toward more sustainable paths in both household debt and the degree of 'financialisation'. These results are shown to be the exact opposite to the observed responses of the economy to a raise in the interest rate charged on bank loans.},

Capital adequacy- and reserve requirements are analysed for their e{$\carriagereturn$}ect on the risk of severe downturns. We develop an agent-based macroeconomic model in which financial contagion is transmitted through balance sheets in an endogenous firm-bank network, that incorporates firm bankruptcy and heterogeneity among banks to capture the fact that contagion e{$\carriagereturn$}ects are bank-specific. Using concepts from the empirical literature to identify amplitude and duration of recessions and expansions we show that more stringent liquidity regulations are best to dampen output fluctuations and prevent severe downturns. Under such regulations both leverage along expansions and amplitude of recessions become smaller. More stringent capital requirements induce larger output fluctuations and lead to deeper, more fragile recessions. This indicates that the capital adequacy requirement is pro-cyclical and therefore not advisable as a measure to prevent financial contagion.},

  institution = {{IMK Working Paper}},
  abstract = {We develop a stock-flow-consistent macroeconomic model with an agent-based focus on corporate credit markets, including a securitization process. Against the background of increased corporate indebtedness, our interest is in quantifying contagion effects that endogenously arise from corporate defaults in a securitized credit portfolio. We calibrate the model to the U.S., where corporate credit securitization has been reintensified in recent years. Simulations deliver adverse medium- to long-term effects as soon as the share of securitized loans in total new loans economy-wide approaches 10\%. Securitization activities above this threshold lead to significant welfare losses from the medium-term onwards. Two transmission channels are conceivable. A collapsing special purpose vehicle (SPV) either causes distortions in the banking sector or increases liquidity constraints that ultimately dampen households' consumption due to their financial investment in the securitized tranches. A more concentrated banking sector reinforces the adverse shock of a liquidation of the SPV. In contrast, a faster and better-equipped bank rescue mechanism in the form of levies within the banking sector helps to contain the consequences of a SPV collapse.},

  author = {Pedrosa, {\'I}talo and Lang, Dany},
  year = {2021},
  pages = {44},
  abstract = {Many interpretations and developments of the Financial Instability Hypothesis (FIH) rely on aggregate leverage ratio indicators to proxy non-financial firms' sector financial fragility. Internal critiques of the FIH's framework calls into question the generality of this assumption. The issues arise due to limitations in untangling the monetary implications of pro-cyclical profits and lacking considerations about the role played by profit-rate heterogeneity. We construct an agent-based stock-flow consistent model (AB-SFC) that adds some elements missing in the FIH. The model bridges the evolutionary theory with a Keynesian-Kaleckian demand engine, including the financial development required to study financial fragility processes. Using a synthetic index measuring the joint profit-debt distribution, we show how cash flows distribution across firms impact the aggregate leverage ratio-systemic financial fragility relation. The reasoning is that the bottom-end of the firms' leverage ratio distribution (low-leverage) is more variable, being a pivotal driver of the economy-wide leverage ratio. Considering that, the systemic financial fragility is a cushioned and imperfect mirror of the aggregate leverage ratio. The results contribute to the literature in many ways. We provide theoretical reasoning that aids comprehension of why the empirical literature finds little support for the FIH. We propose a theoretical underpinning that helps giving substance to the burgeoning empirically-leaned recent literature on the influence of debt and indebtedness on economic fluctuations. We show the relevance of the inclusion of an evolutionary engine into the FIH. Finally, the paper shows the crucial importance of using a micro-macro analysis to analyse the financial fragility of firms.},
