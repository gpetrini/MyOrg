  abstract = {Financialization can be characterized as capital switching from the primary, secondary or tertiary circuit to the quaternary circuit of capital. Housing is a central aspect of financialization. The financialization of mortgage markets demands that not just homes but also homeowners become viewed as financially exploitable. It is exemplified by the securitization of mortgage loans, but also by the use of credit scoring and risk-based pricing. In the past century, mortgage markets were transformed from being a `facilitating market' for homeowners in need of credit to one increasingly facilitating global investment. Since mortgage markets are both local consumer markets and global investment markets, the dynamics of financialization and globalization directly relate homeowners to global investors thereby increasing the volatility in mortgage markets, as the current crisis shows all too well.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we assess the characteristics of the housing market and its main determinants. Using data for 20 industrial countries over the period 1970Q1\textendash 2012Q2 and a discrete-time Weibull duration model, we find that the likelihood of the end of a housing boom or a housing bust increases over time. Additionally, we show that the different phases of the housing market cycle are strongly dependent on the economic activity, but credit market conditions are particularly important in the case of housing booms. The empirical findings also indicate that although housing booms have similar lengths in European and non-European countries, housing busts are typically shorter in European countries. The use of a more flexible specification for the hazard function that is based on cubic splines suggests that it evolves in a nonlinear way. From a policy perspective, our study can be useful for predicting the timing and the length of housing boom\textendash bust cycles. Moreover, it highlights the importance of monetary policy by influencing lending rates and affecting the likelihood of occurrence of housing booms.},

  abstract = {The article analyses the rise in household indebtedness from the point of view of its causes and long-run macroeconomic implications. The analysis is focussed on the US case. Differently from life-cycle interpretations of the phenomenon, and from interpretations in terms of erratic deviations of current income flows from their long-run trend, the rising household debt is viewed as the outcome of persistent changes in income distribution and growing income inequalities. Through household debt, low wages appear to have been brought to coexist with relatively high levels of aggregate demand, thus providing the solution to the contradiction between the necessity of high and rising consumption levels, for the growth of the system's actual output, and a framework of antagonistic conditions of distribution which keeps within limits the real income of the vast majority of society. The question of the long-run sustainability of this substitution of loans for wages is finally discussed. Reprinted by permission of Oxford University Press},

In a phase diagram, dynamics around the u=0 schedule respond to effective demand that econometric estimation (1948-2002) shows to be profit-led. Distributive dynamics around the b=0 curve demonstrate a long-term profit squeeze. Across cycles, the real wage and labor productivity grow at 0.57 per cent per quarter, holding the labor share broadly stable. Modeling the cycle in the (u, b) plane provides a parsimonious description of demand and distributive dynamics, consistent with the macroeconomics embedded in the work of Kalecki, Steindl, Goodwin and many subsequent authors.},

Three linkages of financial engineering to effective demand are identified: (1) funding effects, (2) liquidity preference or speculative effects, and (3) balance sheet or Minsky effects. Data from the Survey of Consumer Finances are used to investigate the importance of asset-backed security-related funding and balance sheet (Minsky) effects in the United States. Evidence is shown that financial engineering has boosted borrowing power at all income levels. The liberal use of expanded borrowing opportunities has fueled the growth of consumption-especially since 1995. However, a secularly rising share of U.S. households have entered the categories of "speculative" or "Ponzi" finance units-a factor that raises doubts about the sustainability of the current spending boom.]},

Desta vez, os efeitos foram suficientemente graves para que a crise fosse comparada \`a de 1929. Por seus impactos negativos sobre o ritmo de crescimento econ\^omico, nos Estados Unidos e no mundo \textquestiondown{} que at\'e 2017 n\~ao havia retomado os patamares anteriores \`a crise \textquestiondown{} e pelo acirramento de conflitos sociais que se seguiu, a crise das hipotecas subprime parece ter explicitado as contradi\c{c}\~oes da configura\c{c}\~ao contempor\^anea do capitalismo americano, em que as finan\c{c}as s\~ao capazes de impor sua l\'ogica e seus condicionantes ao processo de acumula\c{c}\~ao, dando origem a um regime de acumula\c{c}\~ao financeirizado. Se os im\'oveis residenciais e seus v\'inculos com os mercados financeiros estiveram no epicentro da mais grave crise do regime financeirizado, encontravam-se igualmente presentes na fase anterior de ascens\~ao do ciclo, mesmo antes de 2002, quando a acelera\c{c}\~ao do processo de valoriza\c{c}\~ao das resid\^encias americanas, apoiada na pol\'itica de baixas taxa de juros do Federal Reserve, liderou a recupera\c{c}\~ao econ\^omica dos EUA, compensando os efeitos negativos da desvaloriza\c{c}\~ao dos mercados acion\'arios. O objetivo dessa tese \'e, \`a luz dos eventos revelados pela crise subprime, identificar as transforma\c{c}\~oes institucionais que possibilitaram que os im\'oveis residenciais desempenhassem um papel central no regime de acumula\c{c}\~ao financeirizado dos EUA, tanto nas fases de crescimento econ\^omico como na crise que se seguiu. Em outros termos, busca-se mostrar que novas formas de financiar, gerir e construir esses ativos imobili\'arios tamb\'em integraram as transforma\c{c}\~oes ocorridas, a partir dos anos 1970 e 1980, que deram os contornos da configura\c{c}\~ao atual do capitalismo americano},

After presenting empirical evidence for the US economy that the propensity to save increases significantly from the bottom to the top quintile of wage earners, we demonstrate that more equal distributions always lead to higher output in the traditional neo-Kaleckian macroeconomic model. We also present conditions under which a reduction of income inequality among workers turns demand more wage-led. This view is supported by the results of an econometric study for the United States (1967-2010) which show that the rise after 1980 in income inequality has made the US economy more profit-led.},

We reproduce these facts in a calibrated multisector growth model where construction, manufacturing, and services are combined, in different proportions, to produce consumption, business investment, and residential structures. New housing requires land in addition to new structures. The model can also account for important features of industry-level data. In particular, hours and output in all industries are positively correlated, and are most volatile in construction.},

Secondly, the article defends a broad concept of institutions by arguing that some institutions are neither social norms nor decision-theoretic ones, a point that matters for institutional change and stability.

  abstract = {Most empirical models of investment rely on the assumption that firms are able to respond to prices set in centralized securities markets (through the "cost of capital" or "q"). An alternative approach emphasizes the importance of cash flow as a determinant of investment spending, because of a "financing hierarchy," in which internal finance has important cost advantages over external finance. We build on recent research concerning imperfections in markets for equity and debt. This work suggests that some firms do not have sufficient access to external capital markets to enable them to respond to changes in the cost of capital, asset prices, or tax-based investment incentives. To the extent that firms are constrained in their ability to raise funds externally, investment spending may be sensitive to the availability of internal finance. That is, investment may display "excess sensitivity" to movements in cash flow. In this paper, we work within the q theory of investment, and examine the importance of a financing hierarchy created by capital-market imperfections. Using panel data on individual manufacturing firms, we compare the investment behavior of rapidly growing firms that exhaust all of their internal finance with that of mature firms paying dividends. We find that q values remain very high for significant periods of time for firms paying no dividends, relative to those for mature firms. We also find that investment is more sensitive to cash flow for the group of firms that our model implies is most likely to face external finance constraints. These results are consistent with the augmented model we propose, which takes into account different financing regimes for different groups of firms. Some extensions and implications for public policy are discussed at the end.},

Some recent papers have discussed the role of non-capacity generating semi-autonomous expenditures in growth theory. This literature ties together several aspects of heterodox thought: growth and distribution; the Sraffian supermultiplier; Duesenberry's relative income hypothesis; the endogenous money approach and Kalecki\textendash Luxemburg external markets. The basic message is that non-wage sources of effective demand, based on mortgage and consumer credit, can play a key role in inducing capacity investment and driving long-run output growth. This article gives a broad overview of the role of financed-induced semi-autonomous expenditures in growth, cycles and crises, and thus criticizes some of the previous approaches that claim to mimic actual cycles while abstracting from these crucial determinants of economic activity.},

This study uses a vector error correction model to examine relationships between RFI, money, interest rates, and output in pre-deregulation and post-deregulation sub-periods. Results indicate short-term interest rate shocks account for much of RFI variability pre-deregulation. After deregulation, long-term FHA interest rate shocks better account for RFI movements. Results also show that, in the post-deregulation era, RFI shocks have increased predictive power for overall gross domestic product movements. Thus, the study finds altered relationships between RFI and macroeconomic variables.},

  abstract = {According to the Sraffian supermultiplier model, economic growth is driven by the autonomous components of aggregate demand (exports, public spending and autonomous consumption). This paper tests empirically some major implications of the model. For this purpose, we calculate time-series of the autonomous components of aggregate demand and of the supermultiplier for the US, France, Germany, Italy and Spain and describe their patterns in recent decades. We observe that changes in output and in autonomous demand are tightly correlated, both in the long and in the short-run. The supermultiplier is substantially higher and more stable in the US, while in the European countries it is lower and strongly decreasing. Consistently with theory, we find that where the supermultiplier is reasonably stable - i.e., in the US since the 1960s - autonomous demand and output share a common long-run trend (i.e, they are cointegrated). The estimation of a Vector Error-Correction model (VECM) on US data suggests that autonomous demand exerts a long-run effect on GDP, but also that there is simultaneous causality between the two variables. We propose an explanation based on the idea that autonomous demand is socially and historically determined. We then estimate the multiplier of autonomous spending through a panel instrumental-variables approach, finding that a one dollar increase in autonomous demand raises output by 1.6 dollars over four years. A further implication of the model that we test against empirical evidence is that increases in autonomous demand growth tend to be followed by increases in the investment share. Through Granger-causality tests and instrumental variables analysis, we find that this is the case in all five countries. An additional 1\% increase in autonomous demand raises the investment share by 0.57 percentage points of GDP in the long-run},

  abstract = {This paper looks at the effect of demand shocks on the investment share of the economy. Using panel data on 20 OECD countries, we show that the rate of growth of autonomous demand (exports, public spending and housing investment) is positively correlated with subsequent values of the share of business investment in GDP. By means of an instrumental-variables strategy, we confirm a positive effect of demand dynamics on the business investment share. We instrument autonomous demand with US demand for imports interacted with exposure to trade with the US, openness to trade of a country's main export destinations, and military spending. A permanent 1\% increase in autonomous demand growth raises the investment share by 1.5 to 1.9 percentage points of GDP in our preferred panel IV specification. Our results provide empirical support for the view that the influence of aggregate demand on capital accumulation can be a major source of hysteresis. Our results are inconsistent with the canonical New Keynesian 3-equations model, the Neo-Kaleckian model with flexible equilibrium utilization and Classical-Marxian growth models. A positive influence of autonomous demand on the investment share is instead compatible with demand-led models in which capacity adjusts to demand in the long-run.},

By evaluating the relationship between the propensity to invest and the rate of growth of demand for the case of the United States economy in the period from 1985 to 2017, our results provide empirical support for this relation, showing that movements in the output growth rate cause the movements in the induced investment ratio. Other significant result shows that the induced investment share presents a high degree of inertia from on period to another, while the effect of the lagged rate of growth of demand is low but statistically significant, suggesting a tendency for utilization to converge towards some exogenous normal level slowly. This feature, together with other estimated parameters of the model, suggest that the Sraffian Supermultiplier adjustment mechanism has been dynamically stable for the US data in the period under analysis.},

Advent of the Euro and the potential for tensions when sovereign nations subsume their monetary policy into a single response also makes monitoring the business cycle of particular interest for Euro area policy makers. In this paper we summarize recent research on three questions relating to cycles in economic activity --- how to extract cyclical information, how to analyse it, and how to enquire into what special difficulties might be encountered when using cyclical indicators. This survey focuses on our own research which we view as a formalization of some of the procedures developed by Burns and Mitchell at the NBER. However, defence of our position goes beyond continuity with the past and is based on the view that the way in which these investigators defined the business cycle is a very natural one that connects with the way policy makers and commentators discuss the cycle.},

We find that growth in France, Germany, the UK and the USA has been wage-led, whereas Austria and the Netherlands have been profit-led. In the case of Austria a domestically wage-led economy changes to profit-led when including the effect of distribution on external trade. The Netherlands, however, are already profit-led without external trade. Our results so far only partially confirm Bhaduri and Marglin's theoretical conclusion that wage-led growth becomes less feasible when the effects of distribution on foreign trade are taken into account.},

Recently, Leamer (2007, 2015) claims that housing activities both predict and cause national business cycles in the US. We investigate his claims for a larger set of countries. We also examine the predictive relationship in multiple resolutions or time scales, namely shortrun and long-run variations of business cycles. Structural vector auto-regression (SVAR) models are estimated to test his more contentious causal claim. Our results show that: (1) housing indicators lead business cycles in most countries; (2) such leading relationship is the most prominent in the long-run. In addition, our SVAR results for the US indicate that housing factors are likely independent drivers of business cycles. Housing starts predict short-run variations in business cycles, while housing prices predict long-run variations better. The cross-country evidences are less certain. Generally, our findings on timescale based relationships between housing and macro economy put restrictions on future models of monetary transmissions.},

Specifically, it integrates the Veblenian concept of conspicuous consumption into a typical Bhaduri-Marglin model by assuming that relative consumption concerns matter primarily within the working class. If in such a framework the profit share increases and the corresponding decrease in workers' income is distributed unevenly, efforts to ''keep up with the Joneses'' may increase consumption and, hence, lead to a consumption-driven profit-led regime. The model's empirical relevance is illustrated with respect to the pre-crisis developments as observed in the U.S.},

  abstract = {The outbreak of the financial crisis in 2008 witnessed a significant contraction in US consumption spending, as households began deleveraging following a period marked by historically high levels of household borrowing. These events call into question the canonical life-cycle theory of consumption, with its benign view of debt as a neutral instrument of optimal intertemporal expenditure smoothing. This paper draws attention to an alternative, post-Keynesian account of consumption spending in which current income, household borrowing and household indebtedness all affect current consumption. Central to the analysis is an empirical investigation of US consumption spending since the 1950s. The results of this inquiry cast doubt on the life-cycle hypothesis, but are congruent with the alternative, post-Keynesian account of consumption.},

  abstract = {Wage growth and consumer price inflation in the United States remain weak, despite robust labor market and a healthy economy. This has been a conundrum for policymakers and economists alike, albeit it is not without parallels. In this paper, we analyze recent trends in the labor market. We point out that a number of indicators are providing mixed signals about the tight labor market, including wage growth that has remained muted, vacancy duration rates that have stayed remarkable stable in certain sectors, and the rate of capacity utilization, which is cyclically low and out of sync with other measures of resource utilization (e.g., output gap and unemployment rate). This leads us to conclude that there could be other forces that explain these phenomena. In this paper, we focus on capacity utilization and contend that low capacity utilization rates are the outcome of strategic decision-making by corporations, rather than inefficient demand, which permits firms to manage their resources more effectively. It seems to be particularly important when economic and policy uncertainties are elevated, such as in the post-financial crisis environment. More flexible use of capacity has implications not only for the labor market, but also for investments. Understanding capacity utilization would contribute to monetary policy formulation when the signal coming from the rate of capacity utilization is not consistent with those coming from the labor market and the output gap. This points to the need to continue monitor a broad range of indicators to avoid potential policy errors.},

  abstract = {The 1990s, especially in the United States, witnessed an unprecedented change in income distribution, with a large redistribution towards rentiers on the one hand, and towards the upper ranks of the managerial bureaucracy on the other hand, as became ever more obvious after the financial scandals affecting large corporations such as Enron and Worldcom. This has also been accompanied by large capital gains that benefited top-file managers as well as shareholders. Ordinary employees and workers, as a counterpart, have seen their real purchasing power stagnate. Despite all this, and in contrast to the predictions of the canonical Kaleckian growth model, many countries achieved respectable growth rates of capital and output. The purpose of the present paper is to explain this paradox and to provide a consistent post-Keynesian model of growth that would model the main features identified above, making a distinction between managerial labour, basically overhead labour, and workers, essentially direct labour - a distinction that was recommended, but never implemented by Kaldor. The model is based on target-return pricing procedures. We then study the implications of cadrisme, a managerial-friendly regime based on large pay packages for the managerial class.},

  abstract = {Of the components of GDP, residential investment offers by far the best early warning sign of an oncoming recession. Since World War II we have had eight recessions preceded by substantial problems in housing and consumer durables. Housing did not give an early warning of the Department of Defense Downturn after the Korean Armistice in 1953 or the Internet Comeuppance in 2001, nor should it have. By virtue of its prominence in our recessions, it makes sense for housing to play a prominent role in the conduct of monetary policy. A modified Taylor Rule would depend on a long-term measure of inflation having little to do with the phase in the cycle, and, in place of Taylor's output gap, housing starts and the change in housing starts, which together form the best forward-looking indicator of the cycle of which I am aware. This would create pre-emptive anti-inflation policy in the middle of the expansions when housing is not so sensitive to interest rates, making it less likely that anti-inflation policies would be needed near the ends of expansions when housing is very interest rate sensitive, thus making our recessions less frequent and/or less severe.},

Least squares, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods are considered for estimating these models. Different procedures for model selection and model specification are treated and a wide range of tests and criteria for model checking are introduced. Causality analysis, impulse response analysis and innovation accounting are presented as tools for structural analysis. The book is accessible to graduate students in business and economics. In addition, multiple time series courses in other fields such as statistics and engineering may be based on it. Applied researchers involved in analyzing multiple time series may benefit from the book as it provides the background and tools for their tasks.

Concerns related to supply, particularly at the higher segment of the market, lead these discussions. In this respect, basic regression estimations indicate that over the post-2010 period, income elasticity of house price changes is negative, despite housing being a normal good. In order to reveal the underlying reason, we discuss the role of income distribution. Our empirical analyses suggest that the share of bottom (the top) income quintiles are positively (is negatively) correlated with house price changes. Given the current ample stock of houses, at the high-end of the market, a demand surge led by an increase in the income share of the top income quintile may not put pressure on house prices. In addition, the declining income share of bottom three income quintiles may lead to a reduction in their housing demand. Thus, policies directed to improving income equality might help mitigate the imbalances in the housing market.},

The micro-econometric literature improves our understanding of the link between wealth and expenditure and distinguishes among the alternative hypotheses \textendash{} of direct wealth effect, common causality and collateral channel \textendash{} that have been proposed to explain this relationship. The relationship between wealth and consumer spending appears to be strong, but there is some disagreement as to its size and nature.

Chapters adopt a political economy approach to discuss and analyse crucial issues linked to social and economic inequalities, poverty and deprivation as well as to labour market changes. These are issues which are greatly affected by the recent economic crisis and by the neoliberal policies for fiscal discipline, reduce of public spending and labour market deregulation that were implemented to most countries, and particularly to those where the consequences of the crisis were more severe.},

Over this period, capital gains averaged 8\% of national income and comprised a third of total capital income. Capital gains are not included in the national income and product accounts, where the definition of national income reflects the goal of measuring current production. To explain the accumulation of household wealth and distribution of capital income, both of which are affected by changes in asset prices, this paper uses the Haig-Simons income concept, which includes capital gains. Accounting for capital gains increases the measured capital share of income by 5 p.p., increases the comprehensive savings rate (inclusive of capital gains) by 6 p.p., and leads to a greater measured increase in income inequality.},

This volume argues that residential housing and housing finance systems have important causal consequences for political behavior, social stability, the structure of welfare states, and macroeconomic outcomes. Put bluntly, home equity and social equity are often at odds. The individual country chapters and paired country comparisons show specific instances of these outcomes, while Chapter 9 considers the origins and responses to the 2007\textendash 08 crises.

Minsky's work has inspired a growing body of literature on theoretical business cycle models, but relatively little work has been done in the empirical field. In particular, while interest in financial cycles has risen significantly after the 2007-8 financial crash, and recent empirical studies have explored the impact of debt on aggregate demand or its effect on the probability of financial crises, the literature does not test for endogenous cycle mechanisms. In contrast, the present paper investigates econometrically whether or not business cycles are driven by corporate debt and/or by mortgage debt. We estimate simple vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) models, using historical macroeconomic data for the USA (1889-2015) and the UK (1882-2010). We find robust evidence of endogenous corporate debt-driven cycles for the USA, weak evidence of mortgage debt-driven cycles in the USA and no evidence of corporate or mortgage debt-driven cycles for the UK.},

This paper examines recent institutional shifts in European mortgage markets and specifies three analytically distinct models of debt accumulation: inclusion, extension and intensity. While existing research has emphasized inclusion (access to homeownership), we show that financial intensification is an important determinant of cross-national variation in debt. We assess the variation in financial intensity in six European countries (France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain) using household-level survey data. Our results show that inclusion and expansion explain only part of the cross-national variation in mortgage debt to income ratios. Furthermore, household financial behavior is consistent with the financial intensity model, and variation in the degree of financial intensification explains a substantial portion of the cross-national difference in debt levels.},

(2) Fiscal policy focusing on stabilizing the government debt to GDP ratio is destabilizing, counter-cyclical \ldots scal policy lowers output volatility. (3) Lower capital gain and/or corporate tax rates raise output volatility. (4) Swift counter-cyclical reaction of monetary policy to deviations from targets by adjusting the short-term fund rate is necessary, but not su\textcent{} cient for stability, as the `pass through'to long-term interest rates is crucial. (5) Enforcing stricter/softer sectorial creditworthiness criteria vis-a-vis home buyers during the boom/recession reduces output and home price volatility and might be superior to pure interest policy.},

  abstract = {While many European countries experienced a global housing boom in the early/mid-2000s, house prices and mortgage debt in Germany stagnated. Therefore, the German housing system is considered to be operating outside financialized capitalism. Despite Germany's apparent stability, we argue that an alternative trajectory of financialization in the German housing market can be observed. This trajectory has followed three stages or `waves'. The first wave started around the time of German unification and is characterized by the failed attempt of West German banks to marketize and liberalize German housing finance. The second wave started in the late 1990s and is characterized by the `financialized privatization' of many public housing associations and the speculative investments of private equity firms and hedge funds. The third wave started during the global financial crisis and is characterized by booming housing prices and the market entry of listed real estate companies.},
