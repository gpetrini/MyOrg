  abstract = {A broadly accepted view contends that the 2007-09 financial crisis in the U.S. was caused by an expansion in the supply of credit to subprime borrowers during the 2001- 2006 credit boom, leading to the spike in defaults and foreclosures that sparked the crisis. We use a large administrative panel of credit file data to examine the evolution of household debt and defaults between 1999 and 2013. Our findings suggest an alternative narrative that challenges the large role of subprime credit in the crisis. We show that credit growth between 2001 and 2007 was concentrated in the prime segment, and debt to high risk borrowers was virtually constant for all debt categories during this period. The rise in mortgage defaults during the crisis was concentrated in the middle of the credit score distribution, and mostly attributable to real estate investors. We argue that previous analyses confounded life cycle debt demand of borrowers who were young at the start of the boom with an expansion in credit supply over that period.},

  abstract = {Demographic and institutional elements, as important drivers of the housing market, should not be neglected because it is not only financial and monetary elements that matter in the case of the housing market. In this context, one relationship, which still remains unclear, is the relationship between the housing and the labour markets. Some research has been undertaken to support the hypothesis that high rates of homeownership lead to high unemployment via increases in the reservation wage. However, further research is needed to address the possible implications of the institutional settings of the labour market in the dynamics of the housing market. The aim of this paper is to bring some light on the link between both markets. In particular, this contribution explains how the housing cycle could be ``amplified'' via a new channel, that is, economic precariousness, which is closely related to job insecurity. Subsequently, we provide evidence in the case of five developed economies, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, over the period 1985\textendash 2013.},

More financially distressed markets, as measured by bankruptcy rates and mortgage default double trigger, are more responsive to changes in FEAR Index than less distressed markets, and cold markets (markets with slow price appreciation) are more responsive than hot markets (markets with rapid price appreciation). We also examine these characteristics jointly and find that cold markets with financial distress are the most responsive to negative sentiment. Finally, we show that home prices are more sensitive to negative sentiment during recessionary periods.},

  abstract = {This paper develops an agent-based model of the UK housing market to study the impact of macroprudential policies on key housing market indicators. This approach enables us to tackle the heterogeneity in this market by modelling the individual behaviour and interactions of first-time buyers, home owners, buy-to-let investors, and renters from the bottom up, and observe the resulting aggregate dynamics in the property and credit markets. The model is calibrated using a large selection of micro-data, mostly from household surveys and housing market data sources. We perform a series of comparative statics exercises to investigate the impact of the size of the rental/buy-to-let sector and different types of buy-to-let investors on housing booms and busts. The results suggest that an increase in the size of the buy-to-let sector may amplify house price cycles and increase house price volatility. Furthermore, in order to illustrate the effects of macroprudential policies on several housing market indicators, we implement a loan-to-income portfolio limit. We find that this policy attenuates the house price cycle.},

Existing literature in the fields of housing studies and comparative political economy, however, has often neglected the historical dynamics of housing finance, while contemporaneously, financial historians have focused almost exclusively on company and not mortgage finance. We identify four different "ideal types" of housing finance systems that developed in mature capitalist economies when organized housing finance institutions began to emerge throughout the long nineteenth century: informal person-to-person lending and state lending as solutions outside specialized banking circuits, and deposit-based and bond-based institutions as banking solutions. We adapt Alexander Gerschenkron's theory of economic backwardness in order to explain the temporal-spatial emergence of these distinct types. We draw a path-dependent conclusion, noting that the more countries developed bond-based mortgage banks in the nineteenth century, the more they tended towards multi-story building structure, low homeownership rates and lower securitization levels in the twentieth century. A collection of unique historical city and country data supports these findings.},

The analysis uses household-level micro datasets allowing for an investigation of the drivers of the decision to move for a large number of OECD countries; as well for identifying differential policy effects across socio-economic groups, underscoring the distributional effect of policies. The evidence strongly supports the view that housing conditions and structural policies influence people's decisions and possibilities to move. A more responsive housing supply is associated with higher residential mobility, suggesting that reforming land-use and planning policies may facilitate moving by reducing house price differences across locations. Social cash and in-kind spending on housing are positively correlated with residential mobility. Higher housing transaction costs, including from transfer taxes, are associated with lower residential mobility, especially among younger households, which are more likely to be first time-buyers. Stricter rental regulations are associated with lower residential mobility, particularly for renters, low-educated and low-income households. Beyond housing policies, more generous cash income support to low-wage jobseekers and minimum income schemes embedded in social transfers are positively associated with residential mobility; while excessive job protection on regular contracts is negatively associated with mobility, particularly for youth, low-income and low-educated individuals.},

Besides, tighter rent controls are linked with lower supply elasticities. In turn, weak supply responsiveness implies that house prices rise more following stronger demand.

For two countries more similar than different in terms of geography, location, government and culture, Canada and the U.S. remain strikingly different in terms of housing finance. Public policy objectives toward housing followed quite different paths over the past seventy years and fundamental differences in banking practices have led to considerably different outcomes in terms of mortgage finance instruments in the two countries. In light of that, it is particularly surprising that homeownership rates do not diverge by much, reaching 67\% in the United States and 64\% in Canada by year-end 2000. We examine some of the differences in policy and in competitive practices between Canada and the U.S. in an attempt to illuminate why differences in rates and terms across the two countries still exist. While a part of the difference remains due to legal constraints concerning the finance of the domestic housing sector, we do not attempt an analysis of the legal structure and focus, rather, on the economics and public policy choices that have led to the observed differences.},

To identify exogenous movements of housing wealth and leverage, we estimate housing supply elasticities for New Zealand urban centers. We construct synthetic panel series by using household survey data to estimate the marginal propensity to consume out of exogenous changes in housing wealth, while controlling for the household leverage ratio. Our empirical results show that, on average, the marginal propensity to consume out of housing wealth is about 3 cents out of one dollar. But it is larger, about 4 cents, in response to falling house wealth than to increasing housing wealth, about 2 cents. We further investigate the role of household indebtedness in accounting for the asymmetric effect. Our findings suggest that household leverage reinforces the housing wealth effect in a housing bust, but dampens the housing wealth effect in a boom.},

An increase (decrease) in US net capital inflows improves (tightens) US dollar funding conditions for non-US global banks, leading them to increase (decrease) foreign lending to third-party borrowing countries. This induces a synchronization of lending across borrowing countries, which translates into an international synchronization of mortgage credit growth and, ultimately, house price growth. Importantly, this synchronization is driven by non-US global banks' common but heterogenous exposure to US dollar funding conditions, not by the common exposure of borrowing countries to non-US global banks. Our results identify a novel channel of international transmission of US dollar funding conditions: As these conditions vary over time, borrowing country pairs whose non-US global creditor banks are more dependent on US dollar funding exhibit higher house price synchronization.},

However, the study of wealth, which is more unequally distributed than income, has been largely understudied within CPE. Using new data from the World Income Database (WID), this article examines how economic, political and institutional dynamics shape wealth-to-income ratios within Western European and OECD countries. It is found that the political and institutional determinants that affect income inequality have no short- or long-run effects on the wealth-to-income ratio. Rather, the rise in wealth-to-income ratios is driven by rising housing prices, as well as price changes in other financial assets, not home ownership or national saving rates. The article concludes by examining how the changing dynamics of housing prices and wealth inequality will increasingly shape intergenerational \textendash{} and associated class-based \textendash{} political conflict in Western Europe.},

This paper investigates the behaviour of private residential investments for the six largest European economies, namely: Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. It employs a common modelling structure based on an error correction approach and country specific models. First, co-integration among the parsimoniously specified set of fundamental variables is detected in all countries. Second, cross-country differences are found in the responsiveness of private residential investments to real prices and to other relevant factors. Germany has the strongest response of private residential investments to house price changes whereas Italy shows the lowest responses. In Spain investments seem to be primarily related to their lagged component and short-term changes in house prices, and show a poor relationship with deviations from long-term fundamentals. In some countries, the lagged component of residential investments seems to point to a high persistency effect.},

The model is calibrated separately to the US, UK, France, and Germany. Quantitatively, both channels are equally relevant for rising house prices. We then study the dynamics in the housing wealth-to-income ratio by computing transitions. The model replicates on average 89 percent of the observed increase in the housing wealth-to-income ratio. The key for replicating the data is the differentiation between residential land as a non-reproducible factor and residential structure as a reproducible factor.},

While housing premia are only moderately smaller than equity premia, they are significantly less volatile and the Sharpe ratio of housing is significantly larger. Hence, three question arise: i) are existing approaches to explain the equity premium puzzle also capable of explaining even larger Sharpe ratios than previously required, ii) can return rates and volatilities of various assets be differentiated, and iii) can different Sharpe ratios between the two risky assets be matched. We analyze these questions, next to business cycle statistics, by including housing into seminal approaches to solve the risk premium puzzle in production economies. Non-disaster economies with habit formation, capital adjustment costs and limited factor mobility fail to generate a Sharpe ratio of housing of the empirically observed size and do not explain co-moving economic activity. A basic model with time-varying disaster risk can reproduce the large Sharpe ratio of housing. Moreover, the model can explain different means and volatilities of the risky assets, economic activity comoves and the model explains the volatility ratio of business investments, residential investments and house prices. However, the model does not allow to disentangle the Sharpe ratios of the risky assets and premia on equity remain too involatile.},

This is different from the pattern in Western economies where households own multiple properties but still live in an owned unit. The paper is situated within the literature on the financialization of housing and the changing meaning of homeownership. We examine the paradox by studying its patterns and dynamics using 2017 China Household Finance Survey data. We find that the owner-renting in China is a result of spatial, temporal and functional mismatches between housing needs. The intrinsic investment strategy and services linked to homeownership have made it imperative to own homes, regardless a household's housing needs. Young, single, better-off and split households, and those in large, expensive cities are more likely to be owners-renting. In addition, institutional barriers in the housing market such as migrant status, housing purchase limit policy, and subsidized housing encourage owner-renting.},

  abstract = {International political economy identifies declining nominal interest rates, securitization, and financial liberalization as drivers of rising housing prices. Despite witnessing these common credit shocks, however, developed economies experienced divergent trends in housing inflation since the 1980s. We offer a comparative political economy explanation of variation in house prices, arguing that by restraining household incomes, wage-setting institutions can blunt financial liberalization's inflationary impact on housing markets. Employing quantitative analysis and a comparative study of Ireland and the Netherlands, we uncover two findings. First, countries where political coalitions in the export sector held veto powers over those in the nontraded sector in national wage setting realized lower housing inflation. Second, the impact of sectoral coalitions on housing prices in OECD countries is similar to that of financial variables. Our results suggest that the organization of labor politics continues to play an important role in mitigating the destabilizing effects of global finance on developed economies.},

A novel price index for residential property prices covering the whole country going back to 1993 is used in a macroeconomic model to estimate key housing market elasticities for Germany. A decomposition suggests that the land price component of house prices is relatively elastic with respect to income and interest rates, while the construction price component responds to income and the level of construction activity. The decomposition also highlights countervailing house price effects of a supply increase: A dampening effect via land prices and a stimulating effect via construction prices.},

Higher prices increase the value of collateral and net wealth of borrowers and thus reduce the likelihood of credit defaults. In contrast, persistent deviations from fundamentals may foster the adverse selection of increasingly risky creditors by banks seeking to expand their loan portfolios, which increases bank distress probabilities. We test these hypotheses using unique data on real estate markets and banks in Germany. House price deviations contribute to bank instability, but nominal house price developments do not. This finding corroborates the importance of deviations from the fundamental value of real estate, rather than just price levels or changes alone, when assessing bank stability.},

Using monthly data, I find that money shocks have real effects on the housing market: both real housing prices and housing sales (new starts and existing homes) rise in the short-run in response to positive shocks to the money supply. Simulations of the theoretical model suggest that, for reasonable parameter values, the estimated price responses are generally consistent with the theory.},

The paper recollects the main features of Minsky's financial instability hypothesis that became so popular in the aftermath of the failure of Lehman's Brothers despite having been totally ignored by mainstream economists until then. It also recalls other important contributions of Minsky to our understanding of a monetized production economy, some of which were quite premonitory. In the second part of the paper, the author mentions what can be considered as weaknesses of Minsky's theoretical framework, which should be avoided in future work. The third part deals with the controversial issue of whether or not Minsky was a post-Keynesian, or considered himself to be part of the post-Keynesian school of thought. The author concludes that indeed Minsky clearly stood in the post-Keynesian camp.},

House pricing and real estate related services are indeed factors associated with GDP growth. The government policies restricting policies housing trade is affecting GDP growth. The regression results support the idea that a raise in real estate prices is correlated with the growth in GDP. However, increasing real estate prices are not always having a good outcome. It is hurting the economic growth in the long-term perspective. Several economists have predicted the collapse of asset prices in China. The primary reason is the unregulated loans given by Chinese banks which will result in a recession. Steps to boost the domestic demand of the Chinese population have to be taken by the Chines leaders. China's economy has an active consumer market which allows China to rely less on the exports and diversifying to other markets. This means that the nation should rely less on companies owned by the states and rely more on private owned companies to be in a competitive environment. President Xi came up with a 2025 economic plan which prioritizing industries like clean-energy, advanced technology, aircraft engine, and big data (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2014.) Raising prices in the real estate market would result in a lack of innovation power since most of the people chose to invest in housing. People put money into real estate that could otherwise go to newly established firms or industrial frontiers. With a lack of money support, firms may find it hard to survive. Also, overly investing in the real estate market will result in an asset bubble. The asset bubble will not only increase the stress of young adults and also increase the chance of potential recession. For further research, studying the real estate cycle of China will be more accurate in showing what exactly happened in China's economic growth.},

  pages = {144},
  abstract = {Business cycle dynamics can shape the wealth distribution through asset price changes, saving responses, or a combination of both. This paper studies the implications of housing booms and busts for wealth inequality, examining two episodes over the last four decades in Spain. I combine fiscal data with household surveys and national accounts to reconstruct the entire wealth distribution and develop a new asset-specific decomposition of wealth accumulation to disentangle the main forces behind wealth inequality dynamics (e.g., capital gains, saving rates). I find that the top 10\% wealth share drops during housing booms, but the decreasing pattern reverts during busts. Differences in capital gains across wealth groups appear to be the main drivers of the decline in wealth concentration during booms. In contrast, persistent differences in saving rates across wealth groups and portfolio reshuffling towards financial assets among top wealth holders are the main explanatory forces behind the reverting evolution during housing busts. I show that the heterogeneity in saving responses is largely driven by differences in portfolio adjustment frictions across wealth groups and that tax incentives can exacerbate this differential behavior. Using a novel personal income and wealth tax panel, I explore the role of tax incentives exploiting quasi-experimental variation created by a large capital income tax reform in a differencesin-differences setting. I find that capital income tax cuts, largely benefiting top wealth holders, explain on average 60\% of the increase in the top 10\% wealth share during the recent housing bust. These results provide novel empirical evidence to enrich macroeconomic theories of wealth inequality over the business cycle.},

We analyse the distributional effects of such a macroprudential policy on mortgage and house price cycles. For identification, we exploit the universe of UK mortgages and a 15\%-limit imposed in 2014 on lenders \textemdash{} not households \textemdash{} for high loan-to-income ratio (LTI) mortgages. Despite some regulatory arbitrage (eg increases in LTV and average loan size), more-constrained lenders issue fewer high-LTI mortgages. Partial substitution by less-constrained lenders leads to overall credit contraction to low-income borrowers in local-areas more exposed to constrained-lenders, lowering house price growth. Following the Brexit referendum (which led to house-price correction), the 2014-policy strongly implies \textemdash{} via lower pre-correction debt \textemdash{} better house prices and mortgage defaults during an episode of house price correction.},

Argumenta-se que a ades\~ao da Espanha \`a Uni\~ao Europeia redefiniu, no contexto europeu, sua posi\c{c}\~ao na divis\~ao internacional do trabalho, a partir da\'i, verifica-se, nas duas \'ultimas d\'ecadas, um conjunto de transforma\c{c}\~oes econ\^omicas e pol\'iticas que repercutiram diretamente em seu processo de urbaniza\c{c}\~ao recente, o que refor\c{c}ou o papel desempenhado pela produ\c{c}\~ao habitacional nas din\^amicas econ\^omicas do pa\'is e produziu um ciclo imobili\'ario sem precedentes. Contudo, este boom imobili\'ario n\~ao se materializou de maneira uniforme pelo territ\'orio espanhol, pelo contr\'ario, a an\'alise da economia regional e urbana do pa\'is indica uma forte concentra\c{c}\~ao espacial deste processo, sobretudo nas principais aglomera\c{c}\~oes urbanas, na costa mediterr\^anea e nos arquip\'elagos. A eclos\~ao da \'ultima crise financeira internacional p\^os fim ao boom imobili\'ario em curso e promoveu uma s\'erie de consequ\^encias na economia, na sociedade e no territ\'orio espanhol, al\'em de uma profunda reorganiza\c{c}\~ao dos mercados financeiro e imobili\'ario do pa\'is. Desde uma perspectiva territorial, o estudo do bairro Arcosur na prov\'incia de Zaragoza representa um dos casos mais emblem\'aticos de obras urbanas interrompidas pela crise, portanto, evidencia aspectos importantes de como as l\'ogicas financeiras e imobili\'arias influenciam o processo de produ\c{c}\~ao do espa\c{c}o urbano na escala local. Considerando os efeitos socioecon\^omicos da crise na Espanha, constatamos uma intensifica\c{c}\~ao dos conflitos sociais, sobretudo porque que as entidades financeiras que receberam dinheiro p\'ublico na gest\~ao da crise tamb\'em foram aquelas que mais tiveram execu\c{c}\~oes hipotecarias em seu favor, configurando, assim, o que Harvey (2003) denomina de acumula\c{c}\~ao por despossess\~ao. Neste contexto, houve uma reorganiza\c{c}\~ao da estrutura e do funcionamento tanto do financeiro como do imobili\'ario no pa\'is, por\'em, o aumento da concentra\c{c}\~ao e centraliza\c{c}\~ao de capital destes setores constituiu um ambiente de neg\'ocios prop\'icio \`a atua\c{c}\~ao de fundos de investimento imobili\'ario nas principais cidades espanholas. Neste sentido, a an\'alise da venda de 1.860 moradias p\'ublicas em Madri ao Grupo Fidere e a Blackstone nos revela tra\c{c}os marcantes das pr\'aticas predat\'orias resultantes das novas articula\c{c}\~oes entre o poder p\'ublico local, o financeiro e imobili\'ario. Esta conjuntura, por sua vez, exigiu por parte da popula\c{c}\~ao uma importante mobiliza\c{c}\~ao social em torno principalmente, da quest\~ao habitacional. Assim, movimentos sociais como a Plataforma dos Afetados pela Hipoteca (PAH) desempenharam um papel extremamente importante no pa\'is alterando a correla\c{c}\~ao de for\c{c}as estabelecida e legitimando a luta pelo direito \`a habita\c{c}\~ao. Em s\'intese, a an\'alise do caso espanhol nos revela como exacerba\c{c}\~ao das finan\c{c}as passa a comandar as mais diversas dimens\~oes da economia e da sociedade, o que faz com que o processo de produ\c{c}\~ao do espa\c{c}o e o acesso a habita\c{c}\~ao estejam submetidos, cada vez mais, aos imperativos do mercado. Deste modo, conclui-se que a implementa\c{c}\~ao de pol\'iticas neoliberais e, consequentemente, o paulatino recuo do Estado de bem-estar social vai na contram\~ao da constru\c{c}\~ao de uma sociedade mais justa e equitativa},

Therefore, the housing price cycle can affect firms' R\&D investment through influencing their real estate value. By examining listed R\&D firms during the housing boom period 2002\textendash 2006 in the U.S., we find that a \$1 increase in real estate value leads a firm to increase its R\&D investment by \$0.38. We also find that this collateral effect is more pronounced among financially constrained R\&D firms than that among unconstrained ones. Additionally, we examine the housing bust period 2008\textendash 2012, and find that real estate depreciation retarded R\&D investment, especially among constrained R\&D firms.},

Our methodology includes identifying a relevant dictionary of positive and negative words, scraping BiggerPockets real estate forums, running a textual sentiment analysis, and finally regressing against fundamental housing market indicators in 34 large metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) to assess sentiment's predictability on home prices.},

In the long run, the desired level of residential capital stock and the existing residential capital stock revert. Empirical results indicate, however, that housing demand can diverge from the existing supply for several years due to the slow adjustment of the residential capital stock to shocks. In the short run, the market therefore has to be cleared by price adjustments. And indeed, it can be shown empirically that changes in prices are significantly and strongly dependent on the level of stock imbalances. Furthermore, housing prices prove to be an important determinant of residential investment, which in turn drives the adjustment process of the residential capital stock towards its desired level.},

  abstract = {Understanding mortgage markets requires understanding the changing roles of and the competition between the primary and secondary markets. A description of the competitive structure of the mortgage market can be summarized as one of dueling charters. Of the two major charters in the industry, one is for depositories (banks and thrifts), which have been traditionally identified as the primary market, and the other is for the government-sponsored enterprises (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac), which operate a secondary market. However, the distinction between primary and secondary markets has grown less important than that between charters. Today there are basically two different ways (e.g., via a bank or via Freddie Mac) of moving money from the capital markets to the mortgage market. The competitive balance in the industry depends on which charter's route is cheaper, primarily in terms of fund-raising and controlling risk. The competition between the charters can be modeled as the balance between the lower costs of the secondary market and the selection advantages of the primary market. This article develops a framework for understanding the evolution and structure of American mortgage markets by modeling this balance and discussing how it has changed over time.},

Using this model we try to simulate some `stylized facts' about the US economy observable during the last four decades. It is argued that for various reasons house-price volatility in the US has increased since the 1980s: house prices seem to have followed a `cobweb' pattern of accelerating instability, leading to the climax of the financial crises in 2007/2008. A new run-up of house prices has already started, pointing towards a looming bubble ahead. The US economy seems to have become addicted to asset-price bubbles as the driving force of the business cycle. It is argued that various institutional changes, which can be linked to the dominant economic ideology, are responsible for these developments.},

  abstract = {House price is affected by households' expectation of future house price trend and volatility, where the expected volatility of housing capital return, indicated by variance, is defined as the housing market risk. Theoretically, risk element cannot be directly inserted in the standard housing models because most of the models are built on the underlying assumption of certainty. Extending the life-cycle model to a two-asset expected utility case with uncertainty, we show house price is affected by housing market risk premium, which is a function of households' risk-aversion coefficient, real housing wealth, and expected housing volatility. Empirical analysis relying on China's 2001\textendash 2018 provincial housing panel data supports the theoretical innovation. Despite the empirical results show that the effect of housing market risk on house price is tiny, simulations suggest that the consideration of risk is quite helpful in analyzing and predicting the long-run house price equilibriums.},

  abstract = {While many European countries experienced a global housing boom in the early/mid-2000s, house prices and mortgage debt in Germany stagnated. Therefore, the German housing system is considered to be operating outside financialized capitalism. Despite Germany's apparent stability, we argue that an alternative trajectory of financialization in the German housing market can be observed. This trajectory has followed three stages or `waves'. The first wave started around the time of German unification and is characterized by the failed attempt of West German banks to marketize and liberalize German housing finance. The second wave started in the late 1990s and is characterized by the `financialized privatization' of many public housing associations and the speculative investments of private equity firms and hedge funds. The third wave started during the global financial crisis and is characterized by booming housing prices and the market entry of listed real estate companies.},

  abstract = {Housing financialization, or the increased dominance of financial markets in the housing sector, has not stopped in the wake of the crisis. Rather, it has reinforced and rescaled itself, expanding into new market segments and urban territories. However, while academic scholarship has convincingly exposed the reconfiguration of financialization processes, it has paid surprisingly little attention to how these processes are also contested from within society and the economy. In response to this gap in the literature, I propose in this contribution a threefold research agenda, calling out for more research on (i) financial market reforms aimed at dismantling finance-led housing accumulation; (ii) policy focused on strengthening the public and affordable housing sector; and (iii) changing modes of urban governance and `anti-political' social movements which can contest housing financialization locally. Taking into account these three fields of inquiry, I invite housing scholars to explore how \textendash{} and if \textendash de-financializing tendencies can become ecologically dominant in post-crisis urban housing markets.},

  abstract = {Prevailing Comparative Political Economy accounts conceptualise the macroeconomic role of the financial sector in advanced economies either through the Varieties of Capitalism's (VoC) emphasis on corporate finance or on the growth model perspective's focus on household debt to support consumption. As neither framework accounts for the important macroeconomic influence of house prices and mortgage credit, we suggest the prevailing Comparative Political Economy accounts of the financial sector remain underdeveloped. Through an econometric evaluation of 18 advanced economies from 1980 to 2017, we demonstrate that household debt has larger and more statistically significant effects on GDP growth than business debt, and household debt volumes are largely determined by house price inflation. These results are consistent across the varieties of capitalism and advanced banking systems, suggesting the VoC's focus on corporate finance is misplaced and the macroeconomic effects of household debt and house prices are underappreciated, especially in non-Anglo-American advanced economies.},

  abstract = {The essays in housing markets contained within this dissertation examine the effect of policy decisions on housing market outcomes in the emerging market context of China and the developed market context of US. Specifically, I estimate the effect of demand- and supply-side quantitative allocation policies on the price elasticity of housing supply and the home price volatility across municipalities in China. At the transaction level, I use Chinese land supply data to examine the substitution of land use types, and present evidence on politically driven land supply decisions that favor industrial land use and specific industries to increase local officials' promotion probabilities. For the US mortgage market, I leverage a unique dataset from Freddie Mac's national mortgage lender survey to examine the effect of quantitative easing on mortgage-backed securities pricing and primary mortgage rates. I find that large-scale purchases of mortgage-backed securities by the Federal Reserve is associated with substantial declines in mortgage rates across the country, but local economic and housing conditions are also important contributing factors to cross-sectional dispersion in mortgage rates. The combined results of these essays reveal policy decisions can have significant impact on housing market outcomes and provide directions for future research.},
