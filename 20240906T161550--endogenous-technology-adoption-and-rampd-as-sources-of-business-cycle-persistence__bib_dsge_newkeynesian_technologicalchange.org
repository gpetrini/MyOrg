** Purpose and contribution


** Relevance

- This is one of the few DSGE models that have [[denote:20240906T150431][Technological change]] together with deterministic growth
  - As a consequence, this is a suitable for comparison with [[denote:20250202T114248][Agent Based Models]], in special with those with [[denote:20240708T155455][Schumpeterian growth models]] flavor


** Methodology


- *Sample:*
- *Model:*
- *Variables:*
- *Shocks:*
- *Validation:* The model is validated by contrasting the estimated results with some empirical regressions.
  In addtion, the authors also perform some *historical decompostions* of the identified shocks
  - Productivity growth of R&D expenditures (measured in terms of patents/researchers)
  - Intensity of adoption of new technologies  (measured in terms of investment in new licenses)
