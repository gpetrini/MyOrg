  abstract = {As the subprime financial crisis erupted in 2008, Wall Street analysts started talking of the Minsky moment. Hyman Minsky's out-of-print 1986 book, Stabilizing an Unstable Economy, would then sell for hundreds of dollars on the internet, until it was reprinted. The paper recollects the main features of Minsky's financial instability hypothesis that became so popular in the aftermath of the failure of Lehman's Brothers despite having been totally ignored by mainstream economists until then. It also recalls other important contributions of Minsky to our understanding of a monetized production economy, some of which were quite premonitory. In the second part of the paper, the author mentions what can be considered as weaknesses of Minsky's theoretical framework, which should be avoided in future work. The third part deals with the controversial issue of whether or not Minsky was a post-Keynesian, or considered himself to be part of the post-Keynesian school of thought. The author concludes that indeed Minsky clearly stood in the post-Keynesian camp.},

  abstract = {Minsky's ideas have recently gained prominence in the mainstream as well as in the heterodox literature. However, there exists no agreement upon the formal presentation of Minsky's insights. The aim of this paper is to survey the literature and identify differences and similarities in the ways through which Minskyan ideas have been formalized. We distinguish between the models that focus on the dynamics of debt or interest, with no or a secondary role for asset prices, and the models in which asset prices play a key role in the dynamic behavior of the economy. Within the first category of models, we make a classification between (i) the Kalecki\textendash Minsky models, (ii) the Kaldor\textendash Minsky models, (iii) the Goodwin\textendash Minsky models, (iv) the credit rationing Minsky models, (v) the endogenous target debt ratio Minsky models and (vi) the Minsky\textendash Veblen models. Within the second category of models, we distinguish between (i) the equity price Minsky models and (ii) the real estate price Minsky models. Key limitations of the models and directions for future research are outlined.},

  author = {Pedrosa, {\'I}talo and Lang, Dany},
  year = {2021},
  pages = {44},
  abstract = {Many interpretations and developments of the Financial Instability Hypothesis (FIH) rely on aggregate leverage ratio indicators to proxy non-financial firms' sector financial fragility. Internal critiques of the FIH's framework calls into question the generality of this assumption. The issues arise due to limitations in untangling the monetary implications of pro-cyclical profits and lacking considerations about the role played by profit-rate heterogeneity. We construct an agent-based stock-flow consistent model (AB-SFC) that adds some elements missing in the FIH. The model bridges the evolutionary theory with a Keynesian-Kaleckian demand engine, including the financial development required to study financial fragility processes. Using a synthetic index measuring the joint profit-debt distribution, we show how cash flows distribution across firms impact the aggregate leverage ratio-systemic financial fragility relation. The reasoning is that the bottom-end of the firms' leverage ratio distribution (low-leverage) is more variable, being a pivotal driver of the economy-wide leverage ratio. Considering that, the systemic financial fragility is a cushioned and imperfect mirror of the aggregate leverage ratio. The results contribute to the literature in many ways. We provide theoretical reasoning that aids comprehension of why the empirical literature finds little support for the FIH. We propose a theoretical underpinning that helps giving substance to the burgeoning empirically-leaned recent literature on the influence of debt and indebtedness on economic fluctuations. We show the relevance of the inclusion of an evolutionary engine into the FIH. Finally, the paper shows the crucial importance of using a micro-macro analysis to analyse the financial fragility of firms.},

Drawing on Minsky's insights into financial instability and cycles, our framework combines household debt dynamics with behavioral asset price dynamics in a Keynesian macro model. We show that endogenous boom-bust cycles can emerge through the interaction between household debt and housing price dynamics. The resulting long waves are combined with a Kaldorian model of short-run business cycles.},
