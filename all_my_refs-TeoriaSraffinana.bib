Five research programmes are detailed (together with some further extensions): the nature and significance of long-period equilibria; the Cambridge Growth Equation and the monetary determination of interest, as alternative theories of distribution; the Sraffa\textendash Keynes synthesis; and the critique of marginalism. The paper also sketches the relations between the Sraffian project and other unorthodox strands in economics. Future prospects for orthodoxy and non-orthodoxy are canvassed. A substantial literature survey is included.},

Most particularly the rising supply function but also the conventional demand function, are shown to have no compelling general theoretical justification. There is no plausible basis for a presumption in favour of the former\textemdash other than the marginal productivity theory of factor pricing, which is itself unsatisfactory. Multiple reasons are suggested for the rise of the apparatus of supply-and-demand functions, notwithstanding its intrinsic implausibility. The classical conception of supply-and-demand is restated and reaffirmed.},

In the literature, production systems containing only basics are more in vogue. In an article on Sraffa's book, Professor Newman* proposes to 'abandon' nonbasics, by omitting them from the system, in the interest of analytical simplicity; particularly, to avoid the possibility of negative prices which a system containing nonbasics may give rise to (see Appendix below). However the existence of nonbasics is an objective property of a system and while nonbasics may be ignored in a first approximation they will have ultimately to be taken into account. Other writers, while considering nonbasics, have adopted, instead of this distinction between commodities,},

Our main tenet is that the social surplus does not exist independently of the institutions (or social order) that oversee its production and distribution, starting from those that prevail in the sphere of production. In this sense we supplement the surplus approach with important insights from the Polanyian approach, from economic archaeology and anthropology, but also from Sraffian authors and Sraffa's manuscripts. Taking inspiration from Garegnani's core while also considering its specificities, this work is a premise to the design of different economic ``cores'' for different stylized economic formations.},

We show that: (1) the real natural rate of interest is unlikely to be negative and (2) it (inconsistently) depends on the neoclassical investment function drawn at a position of full employment, in a model which the economy is demand constrained; (3) both investment and full employment saving are induced by the trend of demand in the longer run and this challenges the usefulness of the notion of a natural or neutral rate of interest, which (4) are also subject to the sraffian capital critique. This is then constrasted to an alternative simple Sraffian Supermultiplier model in which the interest rate and the financial wedge are distributive instead of allocative variables, and there is no natural rate of interest since in the longer run there is no trade-off between consumption and investment and also no full employment of labor. As the capital stock adjusts to demand, potential (capacity) saving will be be determined by investment, and both investment and capacity saving increase when consumption increases. Finally, we briefly illustrate how this alternative model could begin to make sense of the recent relevant stylized facts.},

The alternative nonneoclassical conflict-augmented Phillips curve assumes no labour scarcity, cost-push inflation and that expectations are not always fully passed on to nominal wages. Additionally, this alternative is also more general than the Heterodox-NAIRU models, as it is compatible both with stable and accelerating inflation, depending on the strength of the workers' bargaining power.},

  abstract = {The article seeks to advance discussion about the nature of competition and of the `firm' consistent with a classical-Sraffian perspective on relative prices and distribution. Discussion focuses primarily on the work of James Clifton published from the late 1970's. Clifton's insights have a direct bearing on issues at the heart of broader Sraffian research: how relative prices are anchored by the mobility of capital; whether the rate of profit should be interpreted as the exogenous distributive variable in the Sraffian price system; and, the forces which govern the `normal' rate of profit, including the causal significance of the rate of growth. While Clifton's approach lends support to the interpretation of the rate of profit as a target rate of return, the article takes issue with Semmler's explanation as being endogenous to the price system. An alternative exogenous explanation of the target rate by reference to the rate of growth from Eichner is also considered, but rejected, despite the similarities between the insights of Clifton and Eichner into corporate pricing. Some useful implications from Clifton's analysis\textemdash as to the modeling of classical competition and gravitation\textemdash are also drawn out.},
