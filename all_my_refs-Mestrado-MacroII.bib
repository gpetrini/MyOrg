  abstract = {Using the Keynesian theory of effective demand, this paper demonstrates how particular models, such as that of "cooperative capitalism" enunciated by the left Keynesian social democrats, the Marxian model of "profit squeeze" emphasizing distributive conflict, and even the conservative model relying on "supply side" stimulus, fit in as particular variants of a more general theoretical scheme through a reconstruction of the familiar IS schedule. The argument is weaved around the theme of the relations between unemployment and real wage in the context of both a closed and an open economy to explain the common macroeconomic basis of contesting ideologies.

  abstract = {This paper shows that the neo-Keynesian case for wage-led growth does not generally hold in an open economy model. Wage increases cause a loss of competitiveness that reduces the trade balance. If the economy is relatively open to trade and price elasticities satisfy certain restrictions, the worsening of the trade balance more than outweighs the increase in workers' consumption, thus reducing the growth rate. The main theoretical innovation is a flexible markup pricing rule that allows changes in unit labor costs and exchange rates to affect profit margins. Implications for international relations and class conflict are discussed. Copyright 1989 by Oxford University Press.},
