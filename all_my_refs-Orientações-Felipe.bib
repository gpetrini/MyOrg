A measure of the economic importance of this increase is that at the end of the sample period, the average firm can retire all debt obligations with its cash holdings. Cash ratios increase because firms' cash flows become riskier. In addition, firms change: They hold fewer inventories and receivables and are increasingly R\&D intensive. While the precautionary motive for cash holdings plays an important role in explaining the increase in cash ratios, we find no consistent evidence that agency conflicts contribute to the increase.},

Our general conclusion is that its focus on the plight of small investors is too narrow when applied to these countries. We argue that this group is unlikely to play an important role in most developing and transition countries. External investors may still be crucial, particularly in transition countries, but they are more likely to come in as strategic investors or creditors. The paper also proposes a broader paradigm including other stakeholders and mechanisms of governance in order to better understand the problems facing these countries and generate policy implications that compensate for the weaknesses of capital markets.},

We then examine the relation of investment to each of the two, using a number of alternative proxies for fundamentals.

Assim, \'e inicialmente realizada uma conceitua\c{c}\~ao geral do fen\^omeno por meio de sentidos espec\'ificos, posicionando a quest\~ao abordada. Ap\'os isso, investiga-se suas origens no Brasil e a forma pela qual esse atualmente se manifesta. Por fim, utilizam-se os sentidos previamente definidos para apontar a financeiriza\c{c}\~ao ocorrida na educa\c{c}\~ao superior privada em per\'iodos recentes. Essa \'e apresentada por duas \'oticas: de um lado, um maior endividamento das fam\'ilias atrav\'es de um cr\'edito educacional subsidiado pelo governo, e, de outro, grandes conglomerados educacionais com atitudes de mercado altamente agressivas, em busca de uma valoriza\c{c}\~ao acion\'aria r\'apida e constante. O papel do Estado \'e visto como fundamental nesse processo, tanto atrav\'es de um custoso sistema de cr\'edito educacional (FIES), quanto de um subs\'idio direto e expressivo \`as empresas educacionais (PROUNI). O que se encontra \'e um crescente n\'umero de alunos beneficiados e progressivamente endividados, anexo a uma forte mudan\c{c}a nesse setor, com grande n\'umero de fus\~oes e aquisi\c{c}\~oes, acompanhada de uma concentra\c{c}\~ao de mercado pari passu a entrada dessas grandes corpora\c{c}\~oes no mercado acion\'ario, com valoriza\c{c}\~ao acelerada.

This is important in order to understand the relatively slow growth since the end of the post-war boom and the causes and course of the current crisis. The close relationship between financialization and neoliberalism is emphasised, the latter having gone through a shock phase (of state intervention intended to promote private capital in general and finance in particular), followed by further intervention to sustain financialization and respond to its dysfunctions. Consequently, it is important to distinguish between the often inconsistent and shifting incidence of scholarship, ideology and policy in practice that characterises neoliberalism. Alternative strategies will need to go beyond financialization to the material conditions of production and reproduction themselves.},

Works in the financialisation literature have tried to explain this phenomenon by arguing that rising financial payments and purchases have come at the expense of productive investment.This article shows that such arguments are not supported by the data. It also explains theoretically why rising dividend payments and the growth of corporations' portfolio investment are compatible with the fact that corporations' productive investment did not decline during the first two decades of `neoliberalism' in the USA.There would necessarily be a trade-off between these uses of funds if they were all funded out of current profits, but there is no necessary trade-off because borrowed funds are an additional source. Finally, the article shows that the fall in US corporations' rate of profit (rate of return on investment in fixed assets) fully accounts for the fall in their rate of capital accumulation.},

The term is a catch-all phrase used to denote important changes in the structure of nonfinancial corporations' balance sheets, including the growth of income from financial subsidiaries and investment as well as growth in the transfer of earnings to financial markets in the forms of interest payments, dividend payments and stock buybacks. This paper seeks to empirically explore the relationship between financialization in the U.S economy and real investment at the firm level. Using data from a sample of non-financial corporations from 1973 to 2003, I find a negative relationship between real investment and financialization. First, increased financial investment and increased financial profit opportunities may have crowded out real investment by changing the incentives of firm managers and directing funds away from real investment. Second, increased payments to the financial markets may have impeded real investment by decreasing available internal funds, shortening the planning horizons of the firm management, and increasing uncertainty. These two channels can help explain the negative relationship I find between investment and financialization.},

  abstract = {While there is an agreement that the Fordist accumulation regime has come to an end in the course of the 1970s, there is no agreement on how to characterize the post-Fordist regime (or if a such is already in place). The paper seeks put together various arguments related to financialization (in the broad sense) from a macroeconomic point of view and investigate the relevance of these arguments by means of an analysis stylized facts for EU countries. The paper discusses changes in investment behaviour, consumption behaviour and government expenditures, investigating to what extent changes are related to financialization. Households experience higher debt levels. Rising profits of businesses come with only moderate investment. The notion of a ``finance-dominated'' accumulation regime is proposed to highlight that financial developments crucially shape the pattern and the pace of accumulation. The finance dominated accumulation regime is characterized by a mediocre growth performance and by higher volatility. However, so far deregulated financial markets have not lead to major financial crises in advanced capitalist economies. A possible reason for this is that the size of the state sector has not been substantially reduced despite neoliberal attempts to do so.},

This finding reflects a financialization process of commodities markets and helps explain the synchronized price boom and bust of a broad set of seemingly unrelated commodities in the US in 2006-2008. In contrast, such commodity price comovements were absent in China, which refutes growing commodity demands from emerging economies as the driver.},
