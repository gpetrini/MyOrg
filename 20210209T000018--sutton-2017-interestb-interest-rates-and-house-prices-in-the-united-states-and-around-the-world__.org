| *Background*                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| *Supporting Ideas*                            | Since houses are a long-lasting good, the long term interest rate is the most adequate one. However,  house prices depends on short-term interest rate. The authors highlight the persistance of house prices (both in nominal and in real terms). Real house prices and interest rates move in the same direction                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| *Purpose*                                     | Estimate the response of house prices to changes in short and long-run interest rates                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| *Sample*                                      | Unbalanced panel (1950-2015) composed by 47 Countries (20 Advanced and 27 EMEs). For the US, the estimate quarterly data from 1970 to 2015                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| *Variables*                                   | Explained: Real house price growth ($h^{p}$) and short-term interest rates. Explanatory: real GDP growth ($y$); total employment growth ($l$, proxy for labor market and demographics factors); interest rate variables.  Growth of the domestic bank credit to the non-financial private sector was also initially included, but was eventually dropped because of its high correlation with real GDP growth. They include both real and nominal interest rate since the latter is a important lending criteria. |

| *Results*                                     | Short-term interest rate is the main determinant of house prices, specially outside the US. Demand for houses adjusts slowly to changes in interest rates due to high transaction costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

** US specific results

- Changes in US house prices are highly persistent
- Most lags enter the regression with a positive sign
  + Evidance against random walk model
- GDP and total employment seems to not affect house prices
- Both nominal and real interest rate affects the house price inflation
- House prices respond to long-term interest rate
- A 100 basis-point fall in the nominal US short-term rate generates a rise in real house prices
