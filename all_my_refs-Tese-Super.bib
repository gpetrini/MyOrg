  abstract = {Abstract             We model of demand-led growth with endogenous adjustment of labour supply and productivity, an approach that reconciles Harrod's warranted rate of demand growth with supply. The model delivers a range of growth paths and unemployment rates rather than a single `natural rate'. Theoretically, the steady-state growth path may be dynamically stable or unstable, but empirical calibration favours stability. We show analytically that if demand dynamics are stable, supply will converge to the demand-determined growth path. While a minimum unemployment rate ultimately imposes a supply constraint on growth, empirical results show that a wide range of growth rates are feasible across different demand regimes. The results explain how economies can become trapped with low growth due to weak demand or fiscal austerity and suggest policy responses to stagnant demand.},

  abstract = {This contribution is a critical reconsideration of the supermultiplier model put forward by Serrano, Freitas and Bhering (2019; `SFB') in this journal. Reformulating their discrete-time model in a way that makes the length of the adjustment period explicit, it aks whether two elementary postulates of a sound modelling are satisfied: (a) A model should also remain well-defined when the adjustment period shrinks to zero; (b) The main qualitative dynamic properties should not essentially be affected by the choice of the adjustment period. It is found that postulate (a) is fulfilled but, regarding the presence of cyclical dynamics, postulate (b) is violated. In addition, the stability condition in the continuous-time version has an unsatisfactory economic implication. On the other hand, a rival supermultiplier model (specified along the lines proposed by, in particular, Allain and Lavoie) is spared from these problems. This suggests that the problem in SFB is caused by too strong an accelerator mechanism.},

  abstract = {{$<$}section class="abstract"{$><$}p{$>$}This paper looks at the effect of demand shocks on the investment share of the economy. Using panel data on 20 OECD countries, we show that the rate of growth of autonomous demand (exports, public spending, and housing investment) is positively correlated with subsequent values of the share of business investment in GDP. By means of an instrumental-variables (IV) strategy, we confirm a positive effect of demand dynamics on the business investment share. We instrument autonomous demand with (i) US demand for imports interacted with exposure to trade with the US, (ii) openness to trade of a country's main export destinations, and (iii) military spending. A permanent 1-percentage-point increase in autonomous-demand growth raises the investment share by 1.5 to 1.9 percentage points of GDP in our preferred panel IV specification. Our results provide empirical support for the view that the influence of aggregate demand on capital accumulation can be a major source of hysteresis. Our results are inconsistent with the canonical New Keynesian three-equations model, the Neo-Kaleckian model with flexible equilibrium utilization, and Classical\textendash Marxian growth models. A positive influence of autonomous demand on the investment share is instead compatible with demand-led models in which capacity adjusts to demand in the long run.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {This paper develops an amended version of the Sraffian Supermultiplier Model incorporating personal income inequality and income taxes to cover an existing gap in the literature. It is demonstrated that a progressive tax shift would engender temporary higher growth rates (during the traverse) and an overall positive level effect. Furthermore, the size of this impact is associated to the product of the propensity to consume and the income share of each income bracket. Secondly, financial features and real estate prices are incorporated in autonomous consumption. Shifts in the financial parameters, as well as the sustainability of autonomous consumption-led growth are discussed, together with the policy conditions that lead to sustainable growth strategies. In this sense, two issues are highlighted. First, the growth of debt-financed consumption has to move in step rather than detached from income distribution, with debt being stopped from replacing systematically disposable income (leading both to higher levels of output as well as to a more stable multiplier). Second, it is argued that an analysis of growth contributions is of chief importance in terms of policy design and implementation, thus preventing the supremacy of autonomous consumption over other components autonomous demand.},
