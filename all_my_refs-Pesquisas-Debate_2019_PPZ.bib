  abstract = {This paper analyzes four fiscal policy rules in a Stock-Flow Consistent model. The rules are: (i) government expenditures as a fixed proportion of GDP; (ii) government deficit as a fixed proportion of GDP; (iii) government debt as a fixed proportion of GDP; and (iv) a balanced budget. Next, the economic trends implied by each rule are analyzed, and they are all compared. Some of the main findings of the exercise can be summarized as follows: the a priori more expansionist (or less contractionist) rules present higher growth rates, ex post; there is an inverse relationship between government debt and firms' debt, with the former being higher under the first rule, and lower in the balanced budget rule, the opposite happening in the case of firms' debt. Finally, considering enterprises' profitability, we conclude that the best fiscal rule for firms is the first one, and, for the banking sector, not surprisingly, it is the balanced budget rule.},

  abstract = {Public investment in Brazil and its relationships with business cycles and fiscal regime This article examines trends in Brazilian public investments and how they relate to business cycles and fiscal regime. The approach of Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012) is used to estimate fiscal multipliers that may change according to the business cycle. Public investment multipliers estimated for Brazil may reach high values during recessions (above 2) and much lower values in booms (at most 0.8). These results support the use of public investments as an instrument of anti-cyclical policy also in addition to the claim that cutting such investments during economic crisis as in the year 2015 has strong unfavorable repercussions. Finally, the article explores the main factors that lie behind the change towards a falling trend of public investments since 2011 with a particular emphasis on the role of the fiscal regime.},
