  abstract = {The literature on development economics in the last decade has rediscovered the role of the exchange rate policy as an important instrument to foster growth. In particular, the works of Rodrik (2008), and Freund and Pierola (2008: 2012) discussed both theoretically and empirically the channels through which an undervalued real exchange rate could benefit the economy. Nonetheless, the debate generated by these seminal works has proven that there is no consensus neither on this positive effect nor on the ways trough which an undervaluation could prove itself beneficial \textendash{} not mentioning the estimation techniques. Moreover, most of the contributions that adopted the theoretical framework of Rodrik seem to disregard the profound transformations that have suffered developing economies in the last thirty years, as they accomplished a greater integration in financial markets, somehow at the detriment of the local productive structure (UNCTAD, 2018). This new evidence is likely to have undermined even more some of the potential channels through which this policy was supposed to operate. Our contribution aims at rethink the latter by constructing an analytical macro model based on Dvoskin, Feldman and Ianni (2018). We will consider, in particular, the financial cost of imported capital goods and the uncertainty related to currency volatility.},
