| *(Interesting) Findings*                      | LtFE convergence to REE is relatively fast. The authors indicates the theoretical and empirical relevance of [cite/t:@anufriev_2012_Evolutionary] model in which [cite/t:@dosi2020] base the expectational switching mechanism. In [cite/t:@anufriev_2012_Evolutionary], adaptative expectations dominates the other in negative feedback markets, while Strong trend extrapolation dominates the positive feedbacks one. Long-run forecaster are usually better described by adaptative learning while short-run is better described by trend-extrapolation. The authors recognize that [[denote:20250202T121115][Fiscal Policy]] can help to bring the economy to a steady-state equilibrium.

** Abstract

#+BEGIN_ABSTRACT
This paper reviews the recent development and new findings of the literature on learning-to-forecast experiments (LtFEs).
In general, the stylized finding in the typical LtFEs, namely the rapid convergence to the rational expectations equilibrium in negative feedback markets and persistent bubbles and crashes in positive feedback markets, is a robust result against several deviations from the baseline design (e.g., number of subjects in each market, price prediction versus quantity decision, short term versus long term predictions, predicting price or returns).
Recent studies also find a high level of consistency between findings from forecasting data from the laboratory and the field, and forecasting accuracy crucially depends on the complexity of the task.

* Specific notes

** Experiments design

- In some experiments, subjects' payoffs are a decreasing function of prediction errors
- LtO usually focus on quantity decisions
- Subjects are asked to predict some specific variable in a multi-period experiment (40-65 periods)
- Usually, subjects do not have information about the others


** Main conclusions of each resent development

:END:

- Comparison between LtFE and LtO :: Convergence to REE is less likely and slower in LtO
  - LtO usually does not discuss market price data generating process
  - Besides none of experiments converges to REE, the volatility in LtO and hybrid experiments is higher
- Large-scale LtFE :: [[denote:20250202T114928][Asset bubble]]s are not ruled out when the number of participants is increased
  - It was expected that the asset price deviation from fundamentals would vanish with the increase of participants
- Longer horizons :: Long-run expectations seems to be more stable than short-run
- Expectations on prices vs returns :: Bubbles are more likely when regards assets returns rather than prices
- Expectations and monetary policy :: Communication between policy makers and investors should be improved in order to stabilize asset prices and [[denote:20250202T120843][Inflation]] rate (together with higher interest rates)
  - Higher interest rate leads to lower liquidity, but it does not affect asset price level alone
  - A strong [[denote:20250203T184305][Taylor Rule]] avoid coordination with trend followers, avoiding a self-fulfilling movement;
- Results from laboratory vs from field :: The papers find consistency among real and simulated data
  - There are also support for the [[denote:20250203T175849][Information Rigidity Models]]
- Laboratory results vs computational experiments :: Computational models perform better when agents follow a simple heuristic rule
- Cognitive ability and forecasting :: Agents use simple heuristics when face complex environments
