* 5SS

* Background and motivation

- Return of industrial policy (Specially after COVID-19)
  - However, it does not takes place in vaccum: Increasing market-power
    - Associate with higher mark-ups
    - Knowledge diffusion and [[denote:20250202T120757][Innovation Diffusion]]
  - Super-star firms
  - What if industrial policy increases market power?
  - What if market power restricts the effectiveness of industrial policy?
- What policy mix can address both economic dynamism and not be constraint to market power?
  - Reduction of dynamism: Declining firm entry, reduction of labor share, and increasing of markup

* Supporting Ideas and hypothesis

- Organization is the locus of Knowledge accumulation
- Knowledge acts as a barrier to use new technologies

* Purpose, Relevance, and Contribution

- There is a knowledge gap since C-Firms do not have equal access to K-Goods technology
  - Gap (\(G\)): Potential (notional) productivity (\(A\)) - accumulated knowledge (\(z\))
    - \(G > 0\) Knowledge constraints (\(\gamma\))
      - This parameter governs the actual productivity
    - Otherwise, the actual productivity is equalto the potential one
  - Firms also absorve knowledge externally

* Methodology

- [[denote:20250202T121415][CATS ABM family]] with Knowledge Gap
- Contrasts a simulation without industrial policy and other with a variety of industrial policy
  - Pure R&D subsidity (RS): affecting \(A\) and \(z\)
  - Blended RS and Knowledge Diffusion: to affect \(\zeta\) and \(\gamma\)
  - Adoption Policy (AP, restrict to policy budget):
    - Basic: Capital replacement subsidy for small addopting firms
    - Public research infrastructure
    - Subsidies to innovators

* Results

- No-policy: Increasing mark-ups as a result of allocation effect due to a more biding Knowledge Constraint
- RS: overall, modest effects
  - On C-Firms
    - Pure: no impact on Growth (discussed latter with cross-sectional analysis)
      - Mechanism: used by firms to accumulate knowledge
        - This could be a result of calibration because the Knowledge Gap is high
        - Also, spill over effects might play a role
        - Only large firms are affected
    - Pro-imitation: boosts GDP growth and amplify market power
    - Pro-adoption: drives growth and reduces market power
  - On K-Firms:
    - Pure: modest growth and no effect on market-power
    - Pro-imitation: Increases market-power with growth boost (discussed latter with cross-sectional analysis)
- Adoption Policy:
  - BAP: no impact on growth, mild positive effect on market power
  - KAP: no impact on growth, reverses the trend market power
