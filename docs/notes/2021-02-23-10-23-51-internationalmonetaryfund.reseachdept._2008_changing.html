              Theoretical background: some scholars stated that
              housing relevance has weakened due to household
              smooth consumption as a decorence of easier credit
              access. Deregulation had promoted more credit access
              due to the removal of interest rate ceilings and

              lender types and loan products. The spill-over

        -&gt; new role of housing -&gt; business sector (note on
        p.122)</p>
        <p>“concludes that these changes have broadened the
        spillovers from the housing sector to the rest of the
        economy and have amplified their impact by strengthening
        the role of housing as collateral.” (International Monetary
        Fund. Reseach Dept. 2008:122)</p>
        <p>Main result: broaden the housing spillover &lt;- housing
        as colateral (note on p.122)</p>
        <p>“he recent booms in house prices and residential
        investment in many advanced economies,” (International

        <p>Background: recent GFC (note on p.122)</p>
        <p>“Some authors advanced the hypothesis that these changes
        have weakened the link between housing and the business
        cycle—for example, easier access to credit allows
        households to better smooth temporary downturns in income
        (Dynan, Elmendorf, and Sichel, 2006).” (International
        Monetary Fund. Reseach Dept. 2008:122)</p>
        <p>Some scholars states that these changes have weakened
        the links between housing sector and business cycle. (note

        <p>“explores the implications for the conduct of monetary

        2008:122)</p>
        <p>Contribution: explore its implications for monetary
        policy (note on p.122)</p>
        <p>“Has there been a change in the housing sector’s
        contribution to the business cycle in advanced economies
        over the past two decades? Are crosscountry differences in
        the role of the housing sector in the business cycle
        related to the institutional characteristics of national
        mortgage markets?” (International Monetary Fund. Reseach
        Dept. 2008:122)</p>
        <p>Questions adressed. The 2nd is more relevant for QCA
        chapter: does institutional particularities affects theses
        changes? (note on p.122)</p>
        <p>“uses a methodology that formally identifi es the
        housing sector as both a source of volatility and a channel
        through which other shocks are transmitted to the broader
        economy.” (International Monetary Fund. Reseach Dept.
        2008:123)</p>
        <p>Methodology: broad cross-country comparison; housing
        sector is a source of both <b>volatility</b> and a
        <b>transmission channel</b> (note on p.123)</p>
        <p>“First, the increased use of homes as collateral has
        amplifi ed the impact of housing sector activity on the
        rest of the economy by strengthening the positive effect of
        rising house prices on consumption via increased household
        borrowing—the ”fi nancial accelerator“ effect.”
        (International Monetary Fund. Reseach Dept. 2008:123)</p>
        <p>How changes affects 1: financial accelerator effect -
        houses as colateral -&gt; increasing household borrowing
        &lt;- house prices effects (note on p.123)</p>
        <p>“Second, monetary policy is now transmitted more through
        the price of homes than through residential investment.”
        (International Monetary Fund. Reseach Dept. 2008:123)</p>
        <p>How it affects 2: Monetary policy transmission is
        through house prices and not residential investment (note
        on p.123)</p>
        <p>“First, because its impact is greater in economies with
        more developed mortgage markets, monetary policy may need
        to be more aggressively responsive to unexpected
        developments in the housing sector and mortgage markets in
        these economies.” (International Monetary Fund. Reseach
        Dept. 2008:123)</p>
        <p>Interesting findings: the effect is greater the more
        developed mortgage market is (note on p.123)</p>
        <p>“Paying increased attention to house price developments
        does not require any change to the formal mandates of major
        central banks, but rather could be achieved by interpreting
        existing mandates in a fl exible manner, for instance by
        extending the time horizon for infl ation and output
        targets.” (International Monetary Fund. Reseach Dept.
        2008:123)</p>
        <p>Policy recomendation: more flexible act rather than
        house prices been the main goal of monetary policy (note on
        p.123)</p>
        <p>“Regulations set interest rate ceilings and quantitative
        limits on mortgage credit and repayment periods. These
        regulations resulted in chronic or temporary credit
        rationing in the mortgage market and made it diffi cult for
        households to access mortgage credit (Girouard and Blöndal,
        2001).” (International Monetary Fund. Reseach Dept.
        2008:123)</p>
        <p>Implications of regulations in the 80s: credit
        rationing. How they acted? interest rate ceilings,
        quantitative limits, repayment periods. (note on p.123)</p>
        <p>“The process of deregulation, however, took different
        forms in various countries (Diamond and Lea, 1992).”
        (International Monetary Fund. Reseach Dept. 2008:123)</p>
        <p>Further reference to how the deregulation occured in
        different countries. (note on p.123)</p>
        <p>“interest rate controls under Regulation Q in the early
        1980s (Green and Wachter, 2007).” (International Monetary
        Fund. Reseach Dept. 2008:124)</p>
        <p>In the US, coincided with Regulation Q. (note on
        p.124)</p>
        <p>“At the same time, the development of a secondary
        mortgage market greatly facilitated the funding of mortgage
        lending via capital markets” (International Monetary Fund.
        Reseach Dept. 2008:124)</p>
        <p>Additionally, development of secondary mortgage market
        -&gt; funding &lt;- capital markets (note on p.124)</p>
        <p>“United Kingdom, deregulation occurred mainly through
        the abolition of credit controls (”the corset“ was
        abolished in 1980)” (International Monetary Fund. Reseach
        Dept. 2008:124)</p>
        <p>In the UK, abolition of credit controls. (note on
        p.124)</p>
        <p>“In Canada, Australia, and the Nordic countries,
        deregulation of housing fi nancial markets was also
        relatively rapid and almost completed by the mid-1980s.”
        (International Monetary Fund. Reseach Dept. 2008:124)</p>
        <p>In these countries, the deregulation was fast. (note on
        p.124)</p>
        <p>“By contrast, in some continental European countries and
        in Japan, the reform process was slower and/or less
        comprehensive.” (International Monetary Fund. Reseach Dept.
        2008:124)</p>
        <p>The deregulation process in this countries was slower.
        (note on p.124)</p>
        <p>“However, public sector fi nancial institutions
        continued to dominate the residential mortgage market in
        these countries, and this constrained the forces of
        competition” (International Monetary Fund. Reseach Dept.
        2008:124)</p>
        <p>Additionally, the presence of public sector in this
        countries still were high. (note on p.124)</p>
        <p>“Countries that experienced faster and deeper
        innovations in mortgage markets (the United States, the
        United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the Nordic
        countries) tend to have higher shares of household loans
        from nonbank financial institutions and a higher stock of
        mortgage debt as a ratio to GDP.” (International Monetary
        Fund. Reseach Dept. 2008:124)</p>
        <p>Figure 3.1 (note on p.124)</p>
        <p>“Following the deregulation of mortgage markets,
        advanced economies all moved toward more competitive
        housing fi nance models—in which households have easier
        access to housingrelated credit, thanks to the increased
        diversity of funding sources, lender types, and loan
        products.” (International Monetary Fund. Reseach Dept.
        2008:125)</p>
        <p>Which instruments and changes allowed for higher
        mortgage access. (note on p.125)</p>
        <p>“High LTV ratios allow borrowers to take out more debt,
        whereas longer repayment terms keep debt-service-to-income
        ratios affordable.” (International Monetary Fund. Reseach
