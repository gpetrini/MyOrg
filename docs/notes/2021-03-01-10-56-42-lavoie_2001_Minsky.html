        <p>“Much like Keynes, Minsky saw modern capitalism as an
        inherently unstable system governed by the behaviour of
        private investment. Yet, unlike Keynes, who had stopped
        short of providing a comprehensive analysis of the
        financial process, Minsky had endogenized finance and
        pointed to the dynamic interaction of the financial with
        the industrial sector as the source of that endogenous
        instability (Dymski and Pollin, 1992, p. 38).” (Lavoie and
        Seccareccia 2001:2075)</p>
        <p>Minsky similarities (instability) and advances
        (interaction of financial with industrial sector) in
        respect to Keynes. (note on p.2075)</p>
        <p>“Hyman Minsky’s principal legacy and, indeed, most
        outstanding contribution to economic analysis is the
        construction of a solid theoretical edifice in which money
        and internal finance play a pivotal role, all of which was
        done within a business cycle perspective.” (Lavoie and
        Seccareccia 2001:2075)</p>
        <p>Minsky main legacy: money and internal finance are
        relevante -&gt; business cycle (note on p.2075)</p>
        <p>“Our belief is that leverage ratios could rise as much
        as they could decline during an economic expansion. It all
        depends on what is happening to such parameters as central
        bank interest rate policy and the behaviour of government
        deficits. Higher debt ratios are not a necessary
        consequence of higher business investment” (Lavoie and
        Seccareccia 2001:2076)</p>
        <p>Main argument: Higher debt ratios are note necessary
        consequence of higher business investment. (note on
        p.2076)</p>
        <p>“For this reason, the chapter also seeks to evaluate
        empirically Minsky’s hypothesis by studying time series
        evidence for Canada and for some of the G-7 countries for
        which appropriate data are available. Our empirical
        research on the presumed procyclical nature of leverage
        ratios offers at best rather mixed evidence in support of
        the financial fragility hypothesis.” (Lavoie and
        Seccareccia 2001:2076)</p>
        <p>[Purp] Purpose of the chapter and sample. (note on
        p.2076)</p>
        <p>“However, a careful reading of this paper shows that the
        formal macroeconomic model, which leads Minsky to conclude
        that economic expansions lead to higher debt and leverage
        ratios for business firms is, in fact, based on a loanable
        funds approach that stands largely in opposition to the
        Keynesian principle of effective demand (Lavoie, 1997).”
        (Lavoie and Seccareccia 2001:2076)</p>
        <p>Minksy analysis depend on loanable funds approach !-&gt;
        PED (note on p.2076)</p>
        <p>“In Minsky’s 1972 model, this upward slope of the
        supply-price curve of investment goods is due to the
        presence of diminishing returns. As Minsky (1982, p. 217)
        says, ‘there is a rate of production of investment goods
        such that a further increase will result in rising costs
        per unit. Thus there is a rising portion of the supply
        curve for investment goods’.” (Lavoie and Seccareccia
        2001:2078)</p>
        <p>Minsly supply-price curve of investment good have
        diminishing returns. (note on p.2078)</p>
        <p>“On the other hand, the negative slope of the demand
        price for investment goods arises in Minsky’s 1972 analysis
        from a sophisticated analysis of the financial
        relationships. For Minsky, when evaluating any asset,
        investors must take into account both the flows of profits
        that this asset will generate in the future and the
        likelihood that the asset eventually may have to be sold at
        a loss on some secondary market. The higher the proportion
        of real investment goods that are being acquired through
        borrowing, the higher the probability that the firm may
        have to face a liquidity crisis, and hence the higher the
        possibility that the assets might have to be sold at a
        loss” (Lavoie and Seccareccia 2001:2078)</p>
        <p>Negative demand curve of investment goods also includes
        the likelihood to sell an asset on some secondary market.
        (note on p.2078)</p>
        <p>“In the JMK book, the rising portion of the supply-price
        schedule of investment goods is no longer due to
        diminishing returns. It is entirely associated with the
        increasing lender’s risk tied with higher marginal leverage
        ratios.” (Lavoie and Seccareccia 2001:2078)</p>
        <p>Latter, the positive slope is related to increasing
        lender’s risk. (note on p.2078)</p>
        <p>“What about the hyperbola representing corporate
        internal funds - the main focus of the present analysis? In
        the 1972 paper, Minsky assumes that these funds are a
        given, without any further explanation. Indeed, he makes
        the following suggestion: ‘Let us assume that the flow of
        corporate internal funds, Nc - gross profits after taxes of
        the Flow of Funds accounts is a close approximation to the
        relevant concept - is invariant with respect to the pace of
        investment’. Thus, for any period, the flow of corporate
        internal funds is a constant, although real investment in
        the same period can take a multiplicity of values.” (Lavoie
        and Seccareccia 2001:2079)</p>
        <p>The most problematic assumption according to the
        authors: corporate internal funds are constant. (note on
        p.2079)</p>
        <p>“Is this still true, however, at the aggregate level?
        The section in JMK where Minsky presents his famous graph
        is then followed by a new section, entitled ‘Aggregate
        Investment’, which discusses explicitly the link between
        his graphical model and aggregate investment (1975,
        pp.113-16). There, Minsky makes use of the insight which he
        had noted a few pages before (page 107) - that is,
        ‘aggregate investment, by affecting income, affects the
        aggregate [corporate internal funds]’.” (Lavoie and
        Seccareccia 2001:2080)</p>
        <p>In some aspects, Minsky recognizes that an increase in
        aggregate investment could affect corporate internal funds,
        but do not formalize it. (note on p.2080)</p>
        <p>“Despite his own admonitions, however, Minsky comes back
        to the conclusion that he had put forth in the case of the
        representative firm. Minsky (ibid.) makes the following
        crucial claim: ‘Whenever the willingness of debt-finance
        increases and is carried through, as is illustrated in
        diagram 5.5, then the objective ratio of the [cash
        commitments] to the [corporate internal funds] increases.’
        Yet diagram 5.5 was derived in the case of the
        representative firm” (Lavoie and Seccareccia 2001:2080)</p>
        <p>Then, Minky make references to the representative firm
        diagram again. (note on p.2080)</p>
        <p>“As John King (1996, p. 70) has clearly underlined, what
        is missing in the early Minsky is a clear representation of
        the determination of profits. Even if Minsky had previously
        referred to Kalecki’s (1937) principle of increasing risk,
        he seems to be totally unaware of the latter’s profit
        equations, at least until 1977.” (Lavoie and Seccareccia
        2001:2081)</p>
        <p>What is missing in Minsky analysis is a representation
        of the determinants of profits. (note on p.2081)</p>
        <p>“Davidson points out that the definition of a
        financially fragile economy may not be as easy as it looks,
        once the impact of effective demand is taken into account.”
        (Lavoie and Seccareccia 2001:2083)</p>
        <p>Davidson also pointed out this flaw (note on p.2083)</p>
        <p>“One must also mention the interesting mathematical
        paper by Delli Gatti and Gallegati (1990), who take as
        close a Minskyan approach as is feasible, and end up with
        possible un-Minskyan results. Their model takes into
        account effective demand, with an endogenous determination
        of both the level of profits and the demand price of
        investment goods. They show that an economy with increasing
        profits and prices of capital assets, as would occur in the
        Minsky boom, ‘does not necessarily lead to an increasing
        leverage ratio’ (1990, p. 370).” (Lavoie and Seccareccia

        <p>Delli Gatti and Gallegati (1990), two minskians, proved
        that the increasing profits does not necessarily lead to an
        increasing leverage ratio. (note on p.2083)</p>
        <p>“In our opinion, it is controversial because it was
        initially derived from a macroeconomic model that was built
        on the loanable funds approach and which ignored the
        principle of effective demand, and because it was later
        heuristically justified on the basis of a microeconomic
        construction subject to the fallacy of composition.”
        (Lavoie and Seccareccia 2001:2083)</p>
        <p>According to the authors, Minsky proposition was
        problematic due to the loanable funds approach with the
        absence of PED. (note on p.2083)</p>
        <p>“As was mentioned earlier in regard to Minsky’s famous
        diagram, the investment and growth process is propelled
        forward by the behaviour of asset prices.” (Lavoie and
        Seccareccia 2001:2084)</p>

        <p>“It ensues that a strong procyclical behaviour of
        corporate indebtedness would provide solid prima facie
        evidence in support of Minsky’s financial fragility
        hypothesis.” (Lavoie and Seccareccia 2001:2085)</p>
        <p>In summary, a procyclical behaviour of corporate
        indebtedness is crucial to HIF (note on p.2085)</p>
        <p>“Figure 4.1 provides evidence for six of the G-7
        countries for which data on corporate indebtedness were
        readily available for the period 1971-95.” (Lavoie and
        Seccareccia 2001:2085)</p>
        <p>[SMPL] (note on p.2085)</p>
        <p>“When some further econometric testing was done to check
        whether, when controlling for other possible factors that
        may have independently impacted on corporate indebtedness,
        the underlying Minsky relationship would hold, the results
        were not much better. These results are presented in Table
        4.1. When applying the standard ADF tests, since at least
        one of the variables (growth in real GDP) was not found to
        be trend-stationary, as displayed in the lower panel of
        Table 4.1,” (Lavoie and Seccareccia 2001:2085)</p>

        <p>“The first on the fiscal side is government budget
        surpluses (+) [or deficits (-)] as a share of GDP of all
        levels of government combined, which would be expected to
        impact positively on debt/equity ratios because of their
        positive effect on the numerator and their negative effect
        on the denominator of the dependent variable. The second
        additional explanatory variable on the monetary side,
        instead, is a measure of real interest rates, calculated as
        the difference between the nominal Treasury bill rates and
        the rates of inflation (of the Canadian Consumer Price
        Index), and which would seek to capture the positive Domar
        effect on corporate indebtedness. Finally, the third
        variable is the personal savings rate, defined as personal
        savings as a percentage of household disposable income, so
        as to pick up the Keynesian effect of consumer demand on
        corporate indebtedness.” (Lavoie and Seccareccia
        2001:2090)</p>
        <p>Additional explanatory variables:</p>
        <dl class="org-dl">
          <dt>government budget surpluses</dt>
          <dd>increase debt and decrease equity</dd>
          <dt>(no term)</dt>
          <dd>Real interest rate</dd>
          <dt>(no term)</dt>
          <dd>Personal savings rate (% household disposable income)
          (note on p.2090)</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>“In the case of budget deficits, the variable had a sign
        that varied somewhat according to specification and, in
        addition, it was not always significant. Possibly, this may
        reflect a problem of specification, owing to the fact that
        the deficit/ GDP variable may not be considered a strictly
        exogenous variable because of the probable feedback effect
        arising from the dependent variable. In much the same way,
        real interest rates had the expected positive sign but, as
        with the budget deficit variable, were not generally
        significant. Finally, the only variable that tended to be
        persistently more significant with the expected positive
        sign was the personal savings rate, which would perhaps
        suggest that the behaviour of household savings do have the
        anticipated positive Keynesian effect on business debt.”

        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li>Budget defints was not always significant</li>
          <li>Real interest rates had the expected positive sign,

        </ul>
        <p>“By implication, this would indicate that, in the
        Granger sense, variations in debt/equity could have caused
        changes in real GDP growth (which is compatible with the
        basic principle of effective demand), while, at the same
        time, we have evidence to support the null hypothesis that
        changes in real GDP growth would not have caused changes in
        debt/equity. In this latter case, once again, the Minsky
        hypothesis did not fare very well, at least, with existing
        Canadian observations on aggregate corporate indebtedness.”
