              advantages” in which capital mobility is central and
              acts throwout institutional arbitrage. VoC scholars
              states that globalization generates an increase of
              divergencies between ideal-types while similarities
              within groups increases. One interesting critic is
              about “residuals type” and how this dual divergence
              will occurr. Other critiques rely on the little role
              of the state, labour and the emphasis on continuity
              insted structural changes. Regarding dissertation
              objetives (QCA) the complementarity between
              institutions is a possible niche to dialogue with
              literature.</td>

        <p>“The discipline has reached a moment of theoretical
        synthesis, similar to that which existed around the concept
        of neocorporatism in the early 1980s, in which a series of
        discrete, incremental theoretical developments coalesce
        into a new theoretical paradigm” (Howell etal 2003:104)</p>
        <p>Emergence of a relative consensus. (note on p.104)</p>
        <p>“These distinct national capitalisms are quite resistant
        to pressures towards convergence upon a single model of
        capitalism” (Howell etal 2003:104)</p>

        theoretical statement of the approach, is reviewed here”
        (Howell etal 2003:104)</p>
        <p>Purpose of the review (note on p.104)</p>
        <p>“The resurgence of neoliberalism, most explicitly in the
        English-speaking world but also in countries like France
        and Italy where its hold had previously seemed weak,
        coupled with evidence of accelerating global economic
        integration, poses a challenge to any intellectual
        framework that posits the existence of distinct national
        models of capitalism and the persistence of nonmarket
        mechanisms of economic regulation” (Howell etal
        2003:105)</p>
        <p>Background and counterfactual. (note on p.105)</p>
        <p>“comprehend the persistence of national divergence and
        the importance of nonmarket forms of economic regulation
        and to reject Margaret Thatcher’s famous insistence that
        there is no alternative.” (Howell etal 2003:105)</p>
        <p>Why particularities persists in the globalization era?
        (note on p.105)</p>
        <p>“nstitutions came to be understood as not simply
        refracting exogenous shocks but increasingly as having some
        independent power to structure the distribution of economic
        power and the interests and behavior of economic actors”
        (Howell etal 2003:105)</p>
        <p>Relevance and notion of institutions in VoC. (note on
        p.105)</p>
        <p>“oncept of path dependence and its implications in
        understanding and identifying both lock-in effects and
        moments of institutional openness” (Howell etal

        <p>Path dependence. (note on p.105)</p>
        <p>“”bringing capital back in.“4 One emphasizes the central
        role played by employers in the construction and
        maintenance of industrial relations and welfare
        institutions and the resulting mutual gains of employers
        and trade unions that have permitted durable cross-class
        alliances.” (Howell etal 2003:105)</p>
        <p>First approach to bring capital back (note on p.105)</p>
        <p>“dination, with or without the cooperation of labor, as
        an explanation of the behavior of economic actors and
        economic outcomes” (Howell etal 2003:106)</p>
        <p>2nd way to bring capital back (note on p.106)</p>
        <p>“These approaches all shared an emphasis upon national
        distinctiveness alongside a high degree of continuity
        within each country over time. In contrast, the influence
        within comparative political economy of theoretical
        currents that stressed an essential discontinuity over time
        in capitalist development, with some degree of convergence
        across countries at any particular time, waned” (Howell
        etal 2003:106)</p>
        <p>More continuity and less discontinuity. (note on
        p.106)</p>
        <p>“alternative approaches to political economy, which are
        criticized for overemphasizing the importance of both the
        state and labor” (Howell etal 2003:106)</p>
        <p>VoC compared to previous approaches: there was too much
        state and labor. (note on p.106)</p>
        <p>“”a firm-centered political economy that regards
        companies as the crucial actors in a capitalist economy“
        (Hall and Soskice, eds., p. 6).” (Howell etal 2003:106)</p>
        <p>VoC and its firm-centric approach. (note on p.106)</p>
        <p>“importance of institutions lies primarily in their
        capacity to structure strategic interaction between
        economic actors and solve firms’ coordination problems”
        (Howell etal 2003:106)</p>
        <p>The little role played by institutions in VoC: solve
        firm’s coordination problems. (note on p.106)</p>
        <p>“Rather, there are likely to be interactions and
        complementarities among institutions, such that one set of
        institutions functions more effectively, or indeed may only
        function effectively, when accompanied by other
        institutions. The chapters are full of examples of these
        complementary institutions.” (Howell etal 2003:107)</p>
        <p>Critic to VoC: some institutions may need
        complementarities.</p>

        independence and coordinated bargaining in the efficient

        central bank credibility is most effective when bargaining
        is coordinated. On the other, independent central banks and
        coordinated bargaining are partial substitutes for each
        other, suggesting alternative paths to low inflation. Mares

        of social insurance in terms of their reliance on skilled
        labor and incidence of labor market risk.11 Estevez-Abe,

        social protection influence skill levels and internal labor
        markets. Particular forms of employment and wage protection
        have a differential impact upon investment in firmspecific,
        industry-specific, and general skills, which in turn

        the authors point out, has been challenged by capital
        mobility and intraindustry trade. Comparative institutional
        advantage points to the advantage countries have in
        particular sectors by virtue of their institutional

        <p>Differences with VoC; (note on p.116)</p>
        <p>“In these accounts, alliances between state elites and
        class and nonclass actors permit the construction of
        institutions, and states continuously have to recreate
        coalitions supporting these institutions. Thus, in The
        Origins of Nonliberal Capitalism, the causal arrows run not
        from a production regime to a set of supporting
        institutions, but in the opposite direction; the
        ”historical causal sequence…extends from statebuilding
        through social policy and labor relations to the
        organization of production“ (Streeck and Yamamura, eds., p.
        14)” (Howell etal 2003:117)</p>
        <p>Reversing causality: from institutions to a production
        regime (note on p.117)</p>
        <p>“On the evidence provided by the contributors to The
        Origins of Nonliberal Capitalism, the centrality of the
        firm in Varieties of Capitalism may be more usefully
        understood as a historically specific reflection of
        contemporary economic conditions than as a more general
        theoretical statemen” (Howell etal 2003:117)</p>
        <p>VoC may not be a general statement: firm-centric
        approach correponds to the contemporaru economic
        conditions. (note on p.117)</p>
        <p>“In the course of exploring the interchange of ideas and
        institutions between Germany and Japan, Lehmbruch argues
        that the process of embedding institutions requires a
        shared cognitive framework. This ”hegemonic discourse“
        selects certain institutions as more cognitively
        conceivable and feasible, imbuing them with greater
        legitimacy than others.” (Howell etal 2003:118)</p>
        <p>There are some similarities with shared mental models
        framework. (note on p.118)</p>
        <p>“The Origins of Nonliberal Capitalism is bound to have
        little to say about the prospect of convergence among
        political economies at the beginning of the twentyfirst
        century. But the historical trajectory of Streeck’s
        introductory chapter, with its emphasis upon the political
        preconditions of institutional development, does provide
        grounds for pessimism about the continued viability of
        national models of nonliberal capitalism” (Howell etal
        2003:118)</p>
        <p>This alternative approach has little to say about
        convergence, but is pessimistic about sustaintability of
        nonliberal regimes. (note on p.118)</p>
        <p>“As noted above, there is a tendency in studies of
        varieties of capitalism for liberal market economies to
        appear as one-dimensional caricatures, refugees from an
        introductory economic textbook defined by their divergence
        from the coordinated market economy model rather than in
        their own terms. Throughout Models of Capitalism, by
        contrast, liberal market economies receive equal billing”
        (Howell etal 2003:120)</p>
        <p>In contrast with previous approaches, Models of
        Capitalists describe Liberal Market economis in its own
        terms and not as a negation of coordenated market. (note on
        p.120)</p>
        <p>“evidence from the 1970s and 1980s shows that British
        firms sought aggressively to change the institutions they

        <p>Institutional arbitrage is at odd with empirical
        evidence: private actors try to change the institutionalset

        <p>Models of capitalism emphasizes the time dimention.

        <p>“What is required, in other words, is not simply

        The next step is to place its distinctive institutional
        analysis within a wider theoretical framework that
        incorporates historical trajectories, class relationships,
        and the development of capitalism as a global system.”
