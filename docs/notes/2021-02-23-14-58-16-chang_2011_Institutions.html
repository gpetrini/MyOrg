        <p>“its neglect of the causality running from development
        to institutions, its inability to see the impossibility of
        a free market, and its belief that the freest market and
        the strongest protection of private property rights are
        best for economic development” (Chang 2011:474)</p>
        <p>Limitations of the dominant view of institutions (note
        on p.474)</p>
        <p>“Influenced by the broader revival of interest in
        institutions in economics, represented by the rise of New
        Institutional Economics in the 1980s, institutions started
        gaining popularity by the early 1990s as an explanation of
        international differences in economic development,” (Chang
        2011:474)</p>
        <p>Background: Institutional economics was a marginal topic
        and have become more popular. (note on p.474)</p>
        <p>“Since the late 1990s, the view that poor-quality
        institutions are the root cause of economic problems in
        developing countries has become widespread.” (Chang
        2011:474)</p>
        <p>Supporting ideas (to be contested): poor-institutions
        are the cause of development problems. <b>Limitation:</b>
        It ignores the causality from development to institutions.
        (note on p.474)</p>
        <p>“The pressure for the adoption of GSIs by developing
        countries also came from various bilateral, regional, and
        multilateral trade and investment agreements, which started
        mushrooming from the mid-1990s.” (Chang 2011:475)</p>
        <p>Background: pressure to underdevelopment countries to
        adopt GSIs. (note on p.475)</p>
        <p>“Of course, the above discussion of external forces is
        not to say that there were no internal pressures for the
        adoption of GSIs in developing countries. GSIs are
        institutions that inherently favour the rich over the poor,
        capital over labour, and finance capital over industrial
        capital. Therefore, many rich people, especially financial
        capitalists, in developing countries have been very much in
        favour of GSIs.” (Chang 2011:476)</p>
        <p>Internal pressure to adopt GSIs. (note on p.476)</p>
        <p>“Theoretical problems with the dominant discourse on
        institutions and economic development” (Chang 2011:476)</p>
        <p>This section is too off-topic regarding QCA chapter
        purposes. (note on p.476)</p>
        <p>“even the same institution in the same dose may be good
        for one country but bad for another. So, using the IPR
        example again, a level of protection of IPRs that may bring
        net benefit to a rich country may be harmful for a
        developing country.” (Chang 2011:482)</p>
        <p>Same institutions may have different outcome across
        countries. (note on p.482)</p>
        <p>“Third, even in the same dose and in the same country,
        the same institution may promote growth at one point in
        time but not in another.” (Chang 2011:483)</p>
        <p>The same institution may have different effects over
        time. (note on p.483)</p>
        <p>“I have shown that mainstream institutional theories
        have a highly problematic understanding of the relationship
        between institutions and economic development. First, they
        more or less ignore the impacts of economic development on
        institutions and focus exclusively on how institutions
        affect development. Second, they believe that institutions
        that provide a higher degree of business freedom and
        stronger protection of private property rights lead to
        higher growth, when there are many theories, including some
        neoclassical theories, which argue otherwise. Third,
        mainstream institutional theories wrongly see the
        relationship between institutions and economic development
        as linear and uniform across time and space. These are
        serious shortcoming for theories that purport to offer
        explanations of growth and structural change across the
        world over long periods of time.” (Chang 2011:483)</p>
        <p>Summary of limitations of current discourse of the
        connections between institutions and development. (note on
        p.483)</p>
        <p>“To begin with, most of the evidence provided in the
        dominant discourse is from cross-section econometric
        studies. Very few studies look at the relationship between
        institutional changes and growth over time in the same
        country.” (Chang 2011:484)</p>
        <p>Most of evidence is cross-sectional and do not include
        the relationship of institutional changes over time. (note
        on p.484)</p>
        <p>“but should include historical narratives and
        comparative historical studies.” (Chang 2011:484)</p>
        <p>Alongside with econometrics (time-series), should
        include both historical narratives and comparative
        historical studies. (note on p.484)</p>
        <p>“By its very nature, the quality of an institution is
        very difficult, if not totally impossible, to quantify, in
        contrast to many ‘policy’ variables, such as the tariff
        rate or the rate of inflation. Therefore, institutional
        qualities are often measured by some indexes based on
        qualitative judgments.” (Chang 2011:485)</p>
        <p>Interesting findings: institutions quality are difficult
        to measure because they have a qualitative nature. There is
        also an bias towards free-market policies in the calculated
        indexes. (note on p.485)</p>
        <p>“Moreover, many of these indexes are based on surveys
        among (especially foreign) businessmen and experts (e.g.,
        academics or financial analysts), many of whom were trained
        in the USA. As a result, they have biases towards
        free-market policies and Anglo-American institutions”
        (Chang 2011:485)</p>
        <p>There is also the bias related to survey data
        (businessman and financial analysts) (note on p.485)</p>
        <p>“To begin with, it is questionable whether we can add up
        all kinds of different institutions into a composite
        concept and measure its quality.” (Chang 2011:486)</p>
        <p>The author also questioned the composite concept of
        measure institutions. (note on p.486)</p>
        <p>“Moreover, in practice, these indexes usually mix up
        incompatible variables - they mix up variables that capture
        the differences in the forms of institutions (such as
        democracy, independent judiciary, absence of state
        ownership) and the functions that they perform (such as
        rule of law, respect for private property, government
        effectiveness, enforceability of contracts, maintenance of
        price stability, the restraint on corruption). However
        desirable it may be to have a comprehensive measure of
        institutional quality, it makes no sense to mix up the form
        variables and the function variables” (Chang 2011:486)</p>
        <p>There is also a limitation due to mixing <b>forms</b>
        and <b>functions</b> of institutions. (note on p.486)</p>
        <p>“In response to this confusion, some have argued that
        the function variables should therefore be preferred over
        the form variables (Aron, 2000).” (Chang 2011:486)</p>
        <p>Further reference for institutional function vs form
        (note on p.486)</p>
        <p>“The econometric studies that support the dominant
        discourse on the relationship between institutions and
        economic development assume, without much critical
        reflection, that the same relationship holds across
        countries. Insofar as the problem is recognized, dummy
        variables, especially ‘regional’ dummy variables (e.g.,
        African dummy) are used to partly deal with it, but this is
        essentially an atheoretical approach. However, if the
        relationship differs across countries, it means, in
        statistical terms, that the ‘homogeneity condition’ is
        violated. This makes the parameters unstable and thereby
        the results sensitive to the sample.” (Chang 2011:487)</p>
        <p>Including dummies representing institutional
        arrangements make the results sensitive to the sample.
        (note on p.487)</p>
        <p>“It is the assumption that institutions can be changed
        easily. However good the GSIs that the dominant discourse
        recommends may be, it would be a pie in the sky, if
        remoulding non-GSIs into GSIs, or importing GSIs into
        countries with missing institutions (e.g., some countries
        did not have patent laws before the TRIPS agreement) is
        very difficult.” (Chang 2011:488)</p>
        <p>Dominant view implicitly assumes that institutions can
        be changed easily. (note on p.488)</p>
        <p>“Actually, some of them think that institutional changes
        are nigh impossible. They think that institutions are
        determined by immutable things such as climate and culture,
        so they cannot be changed, except through some epoch-making
        external shocks, like colonization.” (Chang 2011:489)</p>
        <p>Otherwise, some scholars state that institutions are
        almost immutable (note on p.489)</p>
        <p>“However, it is not always, or even necessarily
        predominantly, because those who have (financial, political
        and ideological) power want to preserve those institutions
        that serve their interests that institutional changes are
        difficult to bring about.” (Chang 2011:490)</p>
        <p>The relevance of power to preserve institutional
        changes. (note on p.490)</p>
        <p>“What they want and how they think they can best achieve
        it depend on who the people in question are. Thus seen, in
        refusing to introduce a GSI, a country may not be being
        ‘irrational’ or driven by the ‘rational’ choice of selfish
        rulers, as mainstream institutional economists are likely
        to think. It may be following its own notion of
        rationality, efficiency and justice. In this sense, the
        path-dependence in the process of institutional evolution
        operates at a more fundamental level than we normally
        think.” (Chang 2011:491)</p>
        <p>However, self-interest and rationality are defined by
        history. The previous interpretation ignores the
        “constitutive” role of institutions. (note on p.491)</p>
        <p>“Second, insofar as some institutions have been
        deliberately designed and codified, they often contain
        rules that make changes difficult. Institutions are meant
        to be stable - otherwise they will have no use. So, if you
        are designing a new institution, you will make it sure that
        it cannot be changed too easily.” (Chang 2011:491)</p>
        <p>Additionally, institutions are designed to be stable;
        otherwise they will have no use. (note on p.491)</p>
        <p>“Unless (at least enough of) its supporting institutions
        are correctly identified and installed at the same time,
        introducing a new institution may not bring about the
        desired outcomes.” (Chang 2011:491)</p>
        <p>Complementary effects of institutions may not lead to
        desired outcomes. (note on p.491)</p>
        <p>“The point is that, even when we accept that a country’s
        institutions (and culture that underlies them) are given,
        deliberate choices still matter because there are always
        elements in a country’s cultural/institutional complex that
        are pulling in different directions. Depending on how
        people interpret their ‘tradition’, which aspects of it
        they choose to highlight, and which interpretation wins in
        political and ideological battles, a country could evolve
        into very different directions.” (Chang 2011:493)</p>
        <p>The difficult to change institutions do not lead to a
        defense of climate-culture school. In summary, neither
        voluntarism nor climate-culture school. (note on p.493)</p>
