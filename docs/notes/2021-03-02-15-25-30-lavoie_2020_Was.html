        <p>The most relevant finding in this paper is the following
        quote about (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">McCulley
        2010</a>) (note on p. 7):</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>McCulley (2009), a former managing director at PIMCO,
          defined standard mortgages, amortized over at a fixed
          interest rate over a long period as hedge finance. He
          defined interest-only mortgages, with borrowers not
          paying back the principal, as speculative finance.
          Mortgages with negative amortization mortgages—the
          so-called 2/28 mortgages—are equivalent to Ponzi
          finance.</p>

        <p>“a number of authors have shown the similar visions of
        Minsky and Schumpeter, with both seeing capitalism as an
        evolutionary process, associated with disequilibria rather
        than equilibrium, and with bank credit playing a
        fundamental role (Ülgen 2014). According to O’Hara (2007)”

        <p>[REF] Similarities between Minsky and Schumpeter (note
        on p.2)</p>
        <p>“My ambition in this paper is to show that while Minsky
        is an unavoidable reference for all those who associate
        themselves with a political economy approach, from the
        standpoint of contemporary post-Keynesian economics there
        are some weaknesses in his works. These must be recognized,
        in the hope that newcomers to heterodox or postKeynesian
        economics will avoid these oversights rather than repeat
        them.” (Lavoie 2020:3)</p>

            <p>“The difference between Keynes and Minsky is that
            for the former, disequilibria push economic activity
            downward, whereas the latter argued that ”we are
            dealing with a system that is inherently unstable, and
            the fundamental instability is upward“ (Minsky 1975, p.
            165).” (Lavoie 2020:4)</p>

            on p.4)</p>
            <p>“One implication of this insight is that as soon as
            an economic unit runs into financial difficulties and
            must sell some of its assets in an attempt to avoid
            financial distress and default on its payments, this
            will have feedback effects on the organizations whose
            financial assets are the liabilities of this distressed
            economic unit. There thus can be a cumulative tide of
            financial problems, leading to a general debt
            deflation.” (Lavoie 2020:4)</p>

            <p>“Minsky (1986a, p. 117) when he argued that in the
            context where ”speculative and conjectural elements are
            powerful, the principle of substitution does not always
            apply.“ As a consequence, ”a rise in the relative
            prices of some set of financial instruments or capital
            assets may very well increase the quantity demanded of
            such financial or capital assets.“” (Lavoie 2020:5)</p>
            <p>Positively sloped curve of financial asset and its
            prices. (note on p.5)</p>
            <p>“There are a few additional gems that can be
            extracted from Minsky’s books. Minsky (1986a, pp.
            174-5) makes the distinction between direct labor and
            overhead labor.” (Lavoie 2020:5)</p>
            <p>Other Minskians colaborations: difference between
            direct and overhead labor. (note on p.5)</p>
            <p>“Associated with Wall Street capitalism, as noted by
            others, Minsky (1986b, 1987, 1991a) identified very
            early on the potential development and dangers of
            securitizing bank loans. Minsky saw securitization as
            an innovation reducing reserve requirements, thus
            enhancing the impotence of central banking, and mostly
            as an innovation that drastically cuts down on the need
            for bank capital.” (Lavoie 2020:5)</p>
            <p>Some antecipations regarding securitization and
            financial inovation -&gt; reducing capital

            banking model being dependent ”upon the wisdom and
            integrity“ of all the involved institutions. Minsky
            (ibid) feared that ”fraud and incompetence will intrude
            in the long chain of securitization,“ in which case
            contagion reactions on a significant scale could occur,

            would call ecological concerns. He saw the potential
            conflict between the goal of full employment and that
            of sustainable growth. He objected to ”the scheme of
            perpetual waste and want“ and to the ”fruitless
            inflationary treadmill, accompanied by what is taken to
            be deterioration in the biological and social
            environment.“ He called for ”a state of disciplined
            wants, a stable population, and a lifting of the
            burdens of war,“ realizing however that the
            ”disciplined-wants requirement is furthest from sight“
            (ibid, p. 155), as it has been observed until now with
            the resistance with which many consumers tend to oppose

            <p>“The first issue is directly related to the
            financial instability hypothesis. Minsky focused on
            banks and firms, as did nearly all his followers until
            the subprime financial crisis. Households do not enter
            the picture in his two major books, although Minsky
            notes that households also face cash flow constraints.
            There is substantial evidence that real estate
            investment is the key driver of business cycles, at
            least in the USA (Fiebiger 2018).” (Lavoie 2020:6)</p>
            <p>FIH is mainly about firms and banks; households were
            out until the GFC (note on p.6)</p>
            <p>“First in his 1964 American Economic Review article,
            Minsky (1964b, p. 328) draws a 2- dimensional graph
            where instability depends on both the business and
            household debt to income ratio. Second, as Jan Kregel
            pointed out to me, Minsky (1964b, pp. 180-181) did
            refer to events that look like those of the subprime
            financial crisis: ”At present real estate assets seem
            to be a more important source of financial distress
            than stock exchange assets…real assets are collateral
            for an extensive amount of debt, both of households and
            of business firms, owned by financial institutions…. If
            the price or real estate should fall very sharply, not
            only will the net worth of households and business
            firms be affected, but also defaults, repossessions,
            and losses by financial intermediaries would occur.“
            Third, when Minsky (1984) explains the events that led
            to the Great Depression, he does mention household
            debt, and especially household mortgages, and the fact
            that at the time mortgages had to be periodically
            refinanced.” (Lavoie 2020:7)</p>

            borrowers not paying back the principal, as speculative
            finance. Mortgages with negative amortization
            mortgages—the so-called 2/28 mortgages—are equivalent

            <p>“Minsky’s explanation of financial crises also
            relies on rising interest rates. One can easily grant
            that interest rates could be rising in the boom because
            the central bank fears inflation and wishes to slow
            down the economy, thus taking the policy decision to
            raise interest rates. But, Minsky believes that rising
            interest rates is a natural phenomenon, which happens
            independently of the behavior of the central bank.”

            appears most clearly when he claimed in 1957 that ”the
            excess of ex ante saving over induced investment will
            be utilized to reduce bank debt“ (Minsky 1982, p. 243).
            This assertion is reproduced by the balance sheets used
            by Minsky (1982, fn. 18) in the case of a downswing. In
            the Kalecki-Keynes framework, any excess of saving over
            investment will lead to unsold production—the Marxian
            profit realization problem—and hence to increases in

            They both use the same equations that assume that
            production, and hence capacity utilization, in the
            consumption good sector is a given and cannot be
            increased. Hence any increase in the share of

            On the one hand, Minsky (1986a, p. 39) argues
            vehemently that ”government debt is free of default
            risk; whatever the government debt contract says will
            be forthcoming will, in fact, be forthcoming.“ MMT
            authors usually recall that this claim is valid as long
            as the debt of the government is issued in its own
            domestic currency. On the other hand, in a later paper,
            Minsky (1991b, p. 166) seems to take an entirely
            different position: ”There is nothing in principle nor
            in the facts of an economy with debts that says that
            the United States cannot become an Argentinaa country
            whose debts, whether denominated in its own or in
