<td class="org-left"><b>Results</b></td>
<td class="org-left">Varieties of residential capitalism are not explained by domestic institutional complementarities <b>alone</b>. (note on p.1). Housing finance system differs from both VoC and welfare state categorizations. (note on p.13). Housing finance system differs from both VoC and welfare state categorizations. (note on p.13). The is no one-to-one match between VoC categories and housing finance system. Housing finance depends more on macroeconomic outcomes and transnational issues than VoC typologies.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left"><b>(Interesting) Findings</b></td>
<td class="org-left">Unlinking other social welfare benefits, houses are also an asset. The authors also state why fixed interest rates are consumer-friendly and the ability to transfer risk to third parties (securitization) is one of the mos important. Housing financing sustem connect people to global capital flows in a more direct way than tax, public debt or employment (note on p.6).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left"><b>Research limitations/implications (Critics)</b></td>
<td class="org-left">Hypothesis are not tested econometrically nor any other empirical method. Mortgage outstanding debt to GDP ratio has more to say about house price increases (compared to other asset) instead the relevance of housing for finance. Aditionally, this outcome is a ratio between flow with a stock.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left"><b>Uncategorized stuff</b></td>
<td class="org-left">Housing finance is not political neutral.  <b>Political consequences:</b> affect voters&rsquo; preferences for the level of public expending, taxation, and interest rates. (note on p.3). Socially rented housing is mostly controlled by blcok-holders &lt;-&gt; shareholders (note on p.18). There is a common-ground between CPE and IPE: homogenizing feature of globalization (at odds with VoC). There must have some overlaps between allowance for securitization and lenders-friendly (not consumer-friendly) institutions. Housing financing sustem connect people to global capital flows in a more direct way than tax, public debt or employment</td>

&ldquo;Comparative and international political economy (CPE and IPE) are justifiably obsessed with finance as a source of power and as a key causal force for domestic and international economic outcomes.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:1)
</p>

<p>
[BACKG] Why include CPE? finance as a source of power. (note on p.1)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yet both CPE and IPE ignore the single largest asset in people&rsquo;s everyday lives and one of the biggest financial assets in most economies: residential property and its associated mortgage debt.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:1)
</p>

<p>
[CONTRI] Lack of attention of residential housing and mortgage debt. (note on p.1)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;First, it shows that housing finance systems are not politically neutral. We argue that the kind of housing people occupy and the property rights surrounding housing can constitute political subjectivities and objective preferences not only about the level of public spending, but also the level and nature of inflation and taxation.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:1)
</p>

<p>
[RESUL] Housing finance system are not polically neutral. (note on p.1)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Second, like the varieties of capitalism literature, we show that housing finance systems also have important complementarities with the larger economy. But we diverge from the varieties literature, suggesting that &lsquo;varieties of residential capitalism&rsquo; are not explained by domestic institutional complementarities alone. Rather, what we refer to as financially repressed and financially liberal systems are globally interdependent.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:1)
</p>

<p>
[RESUL] Varieties of residential capitalism are not explained by domestic institutional complementarities <b>alone</b>. (note on p.1)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But we diverge from the VOC approach in four ways. First, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the degree of financial repression in the housing market systems and VOC&rsquo;s core categorical distinction between liberal and coordinated market economies. Second, VOC eschews causal arguments about macro-economic outcomes in favor of explaining manufacturing and export specialization. Housing market financial systems are much more connected to macro-economic outcomes than to what is being produced.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:2)
</p>

<p>
[FINDS] Divergences from VoC:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>No one-to-one correspondence between financial repression in housing and VoC typologies.</li>
<li>Housing financial systems are more connected to macroeconomic outcomes than firms (as the main subject of VoC) (note on p.2)</li>
</ol>

<p>
&ldquo;Third, macro-economic divergence combined with the salience of housing finance in domestic investment everywhere suggest serious limits to VOC&rsquo;s effort to explain outcomes on the basis of domestic complementarities alone (see also Blyth, 2003). Financially repressed and financially liberal systems are globally interdependent, and the deregulation of national housing finance systems has largely been a transnational phenomena tied to increased global financial&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:2)
</p>

<p>
[FINDS] Divergence from VoC
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>VoC has limitations since is based on <b>domestic complementarities</b> alone (Blyth, 2003)</li>
<li>Housing finance is more transnational and tied to global financial system. (note on p.2)</li>
</ol>

<p>
&ldquo;Fourth, the degree of financial repression is closely connected to the possibilities for social stratification, providing potential continuities in stratification in repressive systems while also the means for the reordering of intergenerational wealth concerns (and their political effects) in financially liberal systems.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:3)
</p>

<p>
[RESUL] degree of financial repression is connected to possibilities for social stratification. (note on p.3)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Our third major point is that housing finance systems have ballot box consequences because, among other things, they affect voters&rsquo; preferences for the level of public spending, taxation, and interest rates.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:3)
</p>

<p>
[RESUL] Political consequences: affect voters&rsquo; preferences for the level of public expendng, taxation, and interest rates. (note on p.3)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But unlike the benefits from welfare programs, houses potentially are tradable assets. The political effects thus depend on specific conjunctural combination of regulation, prices, interest rates, and home ownership rates that, in turn, affect asset prices and the distribution of wealth.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:3)
</p>

<p>
[FINDS] Unlike the benefits from welfare programs, houses potentially are tradable assets. (note on p.3)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In societies with a strongly developed norm of &lsquo;asset-based welfare&rsquo; the distribution of wealth over generations is likely to become a hot political topic, particularly for housing affordability (see Schwartz, Watson, Broome, and Mortensen and Seabrooke, this issue). In societies where the state has provided generous supplements to support access to public or private housing, property booms may encourage citizens to reconsider how well their welfare monies are being distributed (see Tranøy, and Mortensen and Seabrooke, this issue). In societies where housing has been rapidly privatized, access to housing extends beyond a financial and social matter to often become a source of great personal despair (see Zavisca, this issue; OECD, 2005b).&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:3)
</p>

<p>
[FINDS] Distrinctions between <b>asset-based welfare</b>, support access to public or private housing; privatized housing. (note on p.3)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the IPE literature, research on finance largely examines aggregated flows of capital, foreign direct investment, and the effects of liberalization of capital markets on national policy autonomy (Mosley, 2003; Abdelal, 2007).&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:5)
</p>

<p>
International Political Economy view (note on p.5)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The usual point of intersection between the IPE and CPE research domains is typically a debate about the allegedly homogenizing effects of globalization, or consideration of issues of comparative competitiveness (which largely ask, &lsquo;who&rsquo;s doing it better?&rsquo;), rather than trying to assess the articulation of financial flows at different levels in the global economy (Germain, 1997; cf. Seabrooke, 2001).&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:5)
</p>

<p>
[UNCAT] Common-ground between IPE and CPE: homogenizing effects of globalization. (note on p.5)
</p>

&ldquo;how are houses financed? What access is there to mortgage credit within a system? This includes access to first-time home owner grants and subsidies, the determination of fixed or variable interest rates, the deposit requirements for a loan, whether the contractual terms favor the creditor or debtor, the role of non-bank financial intermediaries, and the extent of mortgage securitization.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:6)

&ldquo;The first objective dimension is the degree to which people are owner-occupiers rather than renters, measured by owner-occupation rates. This tells us something — but not everything — about how decommodified housing is.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:7)

&ldquo;High levels of ownership but low commodification indicate a familialist mentality. By contrast, low levels of ownership are not necessarily associated with less market pressure on individuals, because renters do not necessarily have flexibility in their housing choices. The degree of commodification rises with rising mortgage debt, since debt service requires cash income.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:7)

&ldquo;To provide some analytical coherence, we label our four different housing finance systems in ways that correspond to the common distinctions made in the welfare states and VOC literature.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:8)

&ldquo;First, does owner-occupation or high mortgage debt expose people to market pressures or inhibit welfare state development? Gøsta Esping-Andersen used the degree of decommodification in social policy to typologize welfare states as social democratic, conservative, and liberal ideal-types.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:8)

<p>
&ldquo;Esping-Andersen&rsquo;s categories ultimately rest on an explicit causal model and not just a measure of decommodification. For Esping-Andersen, different configurations of class power produced different sets of policies characterized by different degrees of decommodification, stratification, and universality. All other things being equal, more power for labor should produce a correspondingly higher level of decommodification and universality.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:9)

&ldquo;The classic debate between Jim Kemeny (1980); Castles and Ferrera (1996) and Frank Castles (1998, 2002) over the salience of owner-occupied housing for the development of the welfare state suggests this reconsideration (see also Malpass, 2008).&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:10)

&ldquo;The VOC literature splits the world into liberal and coordinated market economies (LMEs and CMEs), depending in part on the degree of financial repression and the presence of coordinating block holders or actors in capital markets. VOC argues that the institutional ensembles constituting LMEs and CMEs produce specialization in different kinds of export goods.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:12)

&ldquo;In addition, many OECD countries have created specialized and varied public, private, and quasi-public financial institutions to manage housing finance within a national economic policy framework (Seabrooke, 2008). These different financial institutions and regulations distribute risk differentially among borrowers and lenders. While legal systems matter here with respect to foreclosure and collateral, the single most important characteristic was the possibility for banks to shift risk onto third parties by selling mortgages into the general market for securities. We will call mortgage systems &lsquo;liberal&rsquo; if this kind of securitization is legal and widespread and &lsquo;repressed &rsquo; if securitization is not possible or minimal.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:13)

&ldquo;After World War II, only the US and Denmark had non-repressive housing finance systems, because they were the only systems that permitted mortgage securitization and relatively long-term mortgage instruments. They also grew out of unique institutional arrangements that followed state-led and community-led responses to widespread economic crises (Seabrooke, 2008). They also did not systematically limit the volume of credit going into housing.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:16)

&ldquo;However, countries with financially repressed housing finance markets do not display a one-to-one correspondence to VOC&rsquo;s CMEs, where blockholders and financial repression characterize industrial credit. Germany, Holland, and Denmark — all CMEs for VOC — all permit mortgage securitization. Indeed, these three countries accounted for 70% of covered bonds in the European market in the late 1990s, with the Danes relatively speaking the most securitized.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:17)

&ldquo;By contrast, all of VOCs LMEs have liberal mortgage finance (LMF). In liberal mortgage economies, securitization enables banks to shift interest rate risk onto the ultimate purchaser of the MBS.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:17)

&ldquo;This permits banks to make large, long-term, fixed interest loans. In turn this permits borrowers to take on quite large amounts of debt because the fixed interest rate cushions borrowers against balance sheet risk (the risk that rising interest rates will trigger higher mortgage payments and throw them into default). This leads to high levels of mortgage debt in proportion to GDP.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:17)

&ldquo;Securitization and long-term mortgage loans interact with the commodification of housing through owner-occupation. The more the mortgage resources available, the bigger the market for housing. And the greater the possibility of borrowing, the more reliant the average buyer on early life cycle market income to service that mortgage.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:18)

&ldquo;Europe&rsquo;s socially rented housing is mostly controlled by powerful blockholders, who act like the controlling shareholders in VOC&rsquo;s CMEs (Gourevitch and Shinn, 2005). But it is easy to overstate their influence on the market. Even in the liberal mortgage economies, powerful institutions or organizations exert tremendous influence precisely because of the risks involved in pricing and floating mortgage bonds and the economies of scale involved in the servicing of mortgages.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:18)

&ldquo;Indeed, within this issue we also point to the importance of understanding how ideas about residential property markets can be used as weapons by political and economic elites (Blyth, 2002), as well as how broader changing attitudes and conventions about these markets can provide clear impulses to those in power (Seabrooke, 2007).&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:19)

&ldquo;These stratifying effects were muted in countries with repressed housing finance. Banks that are unable to shift risks off their books are unlikely to abet borrowers buying up in the market. This dampens housing prices, slows stratification by wealth, and puts less pressure on married women to enter labor markets. Housing market-driven stratification is slower as household income is not polarized between dual-income owning and no-income renting households.&rdquo; (Schwartz and Seabrooke 2009:22)
