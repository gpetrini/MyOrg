        <p>“The object of this book is to elaborate a new framework
        for under­ standing the institutional similarities and
        differences among the devel­ oped economies” (Hall and

        <p>Object of the book: a new institutional framework. Aim
        to developed countries. (note on p.18)</p>
        <p>“We outline the basic approach in this Introduction.
        Subsequent chapters extend and apply it to a wide range of
        issues.” (Hall and Soskice 2001:19)</p>
        <p>Goal of this chapter in particular. (note on p.19)</p>
        <p>“The ‘varieties of capitalism’ approach developed here
        can be seen as an effort to go beyond three perspectives on
        institu­ tional variation that have dominated the study of
        comparative capitalism in the preceding thirty years.2”
        (Hall and Soskice 2001:19)</p>
        <p>VoC is an enhancement of the folowing CPE traditions.
        (note on p.19)</p>
        <p>“this approach saw the principal challenge confronting
        the developed economies as one of modernizing industries
        still dominated by pre-war practices in order to secure
        high rates of national growth” (Hall and Soskice
        2001:19)</p>
        <p>Modernization approach. (note on p.19)</p>
        <p>“Accordingly, those taking this approach focused on the
        institutional structures that gave states lever­ age over
        the private sector, such as planning systems and public
        influ­ ence over the flows of funds in the financial system
        (Cohen 1977; Estrin and Holmes 1983; Zysman 1983; Cox

        Soskice 2001:20)</p>
        <p>Neo-corpratism scholars for futher reference. (note on
        p.20)</p>
        <p>“neo­ corporatism was generally associated with the
        capacity of a state to nego­ tiate durable bargains with
        employers and the trade union movement regarding wages,
        working conditions, and social or economic policy” (Hall
        and Soskice 2001:20)</p>
        <p>Neo-corporatism: State -&gt; negotiate bargains with
        employers and trade unions. (note on p.20)</p>
        <p>“we group analyses of sectoral governance, national
        innovation systems, and flexible production regimes that
        are diverse in some respects but united by several key
        analytic feature” (Hall and Soskice 2001:20)</p>
        <p>Social systems of production approach. (note on
        p.20)</p>
        <p>“behavior of firms. Influenced by the French regulation
        school, they emphasize the move­ ment of firms away from
        mass production toward new production regimes that depend
        on collective institutions at the regional, sectoral, or
        national level (Piore and Sabel 1984; Dore 1986; Streeck
        and Schmitter 1986; Dosi et al. 1988; Boyer 1990; Lazonick
        1991; Campbell et al. 1991; Nelson 1993; Hollingsworth et
        al. 1994; Herrigel 1996; Hollingsworth and Boyer 1997;
        Edquist 1997; Whitley 1999).” (Hall and Soskice
        2001:20)</p>
        <p>From mass to new production regime (Systems of

        <p>“generate trust or enhance learning within economic
        communities.” (Hall and Soskice 2001:21)</p>
        <p>In system of production approach, institutions -&gt;
        enhance learning. (note on p.21)</p>

        <p>Limitations of modernization approach: overestimate what
        governments can achieve. (note on p.21)</p>
        <p>“Neo-corporatist analysis directs our attention to the
        organization of society, but its emphasis on the trade
        union movement underplays the role that firms and employer
        organizations play in the coordination of the economy (d.
        Soskice 1990a; Swenson 1991). We want to bring firms back
        into the center of the analysis of comparative capitalism
        and, without neglecting trade unions, highlight the role

        <p>“As the work on transactions costs and principal­ agent
        relationships in the economics of organization has
        underlined, these are problematic relationships (Milgrom
        and Roberts 1992). Even where hierarchies can be used to
        secure the cooperation of actors, firms encounter problems
        of moral hazard, adverse selection, and shirking.” (Hall

        <p>“From this perspective, it follows that national

        <p>“Institutions, organizations, and culture enter this
        analysis because of the support they provide for the
        relationships firms develop to resolve co­ ordination
        problems. Following North (1990: 3), we define institutions
        as a set of rules, formal or informat that actors generally
        follow, whether for normative, cognitive, or material
        reasons, and organizations as durable entities with
        formally recognized members, whose rules also contribute to
        the institutions of the political economy.9” (Hall and

        <p>“In general, these will be institutions that reduce the

        <p>Which an why some institutions are prefered? (note on

        <p>“A standard literature suggests that these are

        Deliberative institutions are important for several

        <p>“Because we believe such outcomes are the products of
        efforts to coordinate in contexts of strategic interaction,
        however, we reject the contention that they follow from the
        presence of a particular set of institutions alone, at
        least if the latter are defined entirely in terms of formal
        rules or organizations.” (Hall and Soskice 2001:29)</p>
        <p>“But formal institutions are rarely sufficient to
        guarantee that equilibrium” (Hall and Soskice 2001:29)</p>
        <p>“As we have noted, the presence of a set of formal
        institutions is often a necessary precondition for

        <p>Formal institutions may be necessary conditions, but not
        sufficient ones: informal institutions may be required as

        <p>“Accordingly, taking a step beyond many accounts, we
        emphasize the importance of informal rules and
        understandings to securing the equi­ libria in the many
        strategic interactions of the political economy. These
        shared understandings are important elements of the ‘common
        know­ ledge’ that lead participants to coordinate on one
        outcome, rather than another, when both are feasible in the

        <p>“This is an entry point in the analysis for history and
        culture. Many actors learn to follow a set of informal
        rules by virtue of experience with a familiar set of actors
        and the shared understandings that accumulate from this
        experience constitute something like a common culture.”

        <p>“First, although we make use of the influential
        dichotomy between ‘markets’ and ‘hierarchies’ that
        Williamson (1975) has impressed on the field, we do not
        think this exhausts the relevant variation. Markets and
        hierarchies are features of LMEs and CMEs but we stress the
        systematic variation found in the character of corporate
        structure (or hierarchies) across different types of

        <p>“In short, there are important respects in which
        strategy follows structure. For this reason, our approach

        arching institutional structures of the political economy.

        <p>“Following Aoki (1994), we extend this line of reasoning
        to the institu­ tions of the political economy. Here, two

        (or efficiency of) the other.” (Hall and Soskice

        <p>Definition of institutional complementarity according to
        Aoki (1994): the presence of an institution increases the
        returns of the other (smilar to complementary goods). This
        ideia is slight differente from Chang’s: institutions may
        not exist in the absence of other; a set of institution may
        have a similar result as another equivalent one

        <p>“(iii) The education and training systems of liberal
        market economies are generally complementary to these
        highly fluid labor markets. Vocational training is normally
        provided by institutions offering formal educa­ tion that
        focuses on general skills because companies are loath to
        invest in apprenticeship schemes imparting
        industry-specific skills where they have no guarantees that
        other firms will not simply poach their appren­ tices
        without investing in training themselves.” (Hall and

        <p>“How then does technology transfer take place in liberal
        market economies? In large measure, it is secured through
        the movement of scientists and engineers from one company
        to another (or from research institutions to the private
        sector) that fluid labor markets facilitate. These
        scientific personnel bring their technical knowledge with
        them.” (Hall and Soskice 2001:48)</p>

        <p>“Special note should be taken of the complementarities
        between the internal structure of firms and their external
        institutional environ­ ment in liberal and coordinated
        market economies. In LMEs, corporate structures that
        concentrate authority in top management make it easier for
        firms to release labor when facing pressure from financial
        markets and to impose a new strategy on the firm to take
        advantage of the shifting market opportunities that often
        present themselves in economies characterized by highly
        mobile assets. By contrast, in CMEs, where access to
        finance and technology often depends on a firm’s
        attractiveness as a collaborator and hence on its
        reputation, corporate structures that impose more
        consensual forms of decision-making allow firms to develop
        repu­ tations that are not entirely dependent on those of
        its top management. By reducing the capacity of top
        management to act arbitrarily, these structures also
        enhance the firm’s capacity to enter credibly into rela­
        tional contracts with employees and others in economies
        where a firm’s access to many kinds of assets, ranging from
        technology to skills, may depend on its capacity for
        relational contracting” (Hall and Soskice 2001:50)</p>
        <p>Overview of complementarities in LME. (note on p.50)</p>
        <p>“In particular, we are suggesting that it can be
        fruitful to consider how firms coordinate their endeavors
        and to analyze the institutions of the political economy
        from a perspective that asks what kind of support they
        provide for different kinds of coordina­ tion, even when
        the political economies at hand do not correspond to the
        ideal types we have just outlined.” (Hall and Soskice

        <p>“One important axis of difference among CMEs runs
        between those that rely primarily on industry-based
        coordination, as do many of the northern European nations,
        and those with institutional structures that foster
        group-based coordination of the sort found in Japan and
        South Korea.” (Hall and Soskice 2001:51)</p>

        (note on p.51)</p>
        <p>“However, recent developments have dealt a serious blow
        to this account of comparative economic advantage. The most
        important of these include the expansion of intra-industry
        trade and increases in the international mobility of
        capital. If the theory is correct, nations should not
        import and export high volumes of goods from the same
        sector; and there is a real possibility that international
        movements of capital will even out national factor
        endowments. As a result, some economists have become
        skeptical about whether comparative advantages really
        exist, and many have begun to seek other explanations for
        the expansion of trade and the geographic distribution of
        production” (Hall and Soskice 2001:53)</p>

        <p>“concept of compara­ tive institutional advantage. The
        basic idea is that the institutional struc­ ture of a
        particular political economy provides firms with advantages
        for engaging in specific types of activities there. Firms
        can perform some types of activities, which allow them to
        produce some kinds of goods, more efficiently than others
        because of the institutional support they receive for those
        activities in the political economy, and the institutions
        relevant to these activities are not distributed evenly
        across nations.” (Hall and Soskice 2001:54)</p>
        <p>Definition of comparative institutional change. (note on
        p.54)</p>
        <p>“Most of this literature, however, looks for the
        ingredients of absolute advan­ tage, i.e. it identifies
        factors more of which will improve the perform­ ance of any
        economy. We seek institutional features that might confer
        comparative advantage and, thus, be better suited to
        explaining cross­ national patterns of product or process
        specialization (Zysman 1994).” (Hall and Soskice
        2001:55)</p>
        <p>Literature focus on market relations and legal
        framework; other emphasise innovation systems (such as
        Dosi) to explain competitive advantage in absolute terms:
        identifies which facores will improve the performance of
        the economy. (note on p.55)</p>
        <p>“Although there may be types of comparative advantage
        that these institutional frameworks confer that we have not
        yet explored, we focus here on their impact on innovation
        since a firm’s capacity to inovate is crucial to its
        long-run success.” (Hall and Soskice 2001:55)</p>
        <p>Thereafter, the authors exemplifies with a comparative
        analysis for innovation. (note on p.55)</p>
        <p>“Coordinated market economies should be better at
        supporting incre­ mental innovation. This follows from the
        emphasis we have put on the relational requirements of
        company endeavors.” (Hall and Soskice 2001:56)</p>
        <p>Predictions for innovation in CME: incremental ones.
        (note on p.56)</p>
        <p>“However, the institutional framework of liberal market
        economies is highly supportive of radical innovation.”
        (Hall and Soskice 2001:57)</p>
        <p>Institutions in LME, on the other side, supports radical
        innovation. (note on p.57)</p>
        <p>“In short, the institutional frameworks of liberal
        market economies provide companies with better capacities
        for radical innovation, while those of coordinated market
        economies provide superior capacities for incremental
        inovation. Therefore, to the extent allowed by transport
        costs and the efficiency of international markets, there
        should be national patterns of specialization in activities
        and products; and these should reflect rational responses
        to the institutional frameworks identified here rather than
        random geographic agglomeration.” (Hall and Soskice
        2001:58)</p>
        <p>Conclusion of the summary example. (note on p.58)</p>
        <p>“Economists have also long believed that skill levels
        can be important to comparative advantage, and our analysis
        suggests that the availability of labor with particular
        types of skills will be dependent on precisely the kinds of
        institutions that distinguish liberal from coordinated
        market economies.” (Hall and Soskice 2001:61)</p>
        <p>Interesting finding: skill levels by its own is not
        enough to promote comparative advantage. It will depends on
        the institutional sets. (note on p.61)</p>
        <p>“Broadly speaking, the problem was seen as one of
        inducing economic actors to cooperate with the government.”
        (Hall and Soskice 2001:62)</p>
        <p>priviously to VoC, the main goal of policy-making is to
        promote the incentives to induce economic agents to
        cooperate with the government. (note on p.62)</p>
        <p>“From our perspective, however, the principal problem
        facing policy­ makers is quite different: it is one of
        inducing economic actors to co­ operate more effectively
        with each other” (Hall and Soskice 2001:62)</p>
        <p>In VoC, the main goal is to induce agentes to
        <b>cooperate with each other</b>. (note on p.62)</p>
        <p>“Accord­ ingly, one of the principal ways in which
        policy-makers can improve national economic performance is
        to secure better forms of coordination among private-sector
        actors.” (Hall and Soskice 2001:62)</p>
        <p>What government shoudl do? Ensure institutions that
        enable better coordinations. (note on p.62)</p>
        <p>“It follows that economic policies will be effective
        only if they are incen­ tive compatible, namely
        complementary to the coordinating capacities embedded in
        the existing political economy (Wood 1997).” (Hall and
        Soskice 2001:63)</p>
        <p>Most important, those incestives must bem compatibles
        with the capacities embedded in the economy. In other
        words, incentives in LME must be compatible with LME
        capacities. (note on p.63)</p>
        <p>“Let us distinguish between ‘market incentive’ policies
        and ‘coordination-oriented’ policies. The former rely on
        market­ based incentives to induce actors to perform more
        effectively. The latter attempt to improve the competencies
        of firms, such as their skill levels or technological
        capabilities, by addressing firm needs with relative
        precision. Thus, coordination-oriented policies must be
        based on high levels of information about the activities of
        the firm” (Hall and Soskice 2001:64)</p>
        <p>Definition of market and coordination-oriented
        incentives. (note on p.64)</p>
        <p>“here should be a correspondence between types of
        political economies and types of welfare states. And that
        appears to be the case.” (Hall and Soskice 2001:67)</p>
        <p>There should be a relation between VoC typologies and
        types of welfare states. (note on p.67)</p>
        <p>“For political economy, the principal issue raised by
        globalization concerns the stability of regulatory regimes
        and national institutions in the face of heightened
        competitive pressure (Boyer and Drache 1996; Rodrik 1997).”
        (Hall and Soskice 2001:72)</p>
        <p>The main issue regarding globalization in PE literature
        is the stability of regulatory regimes and national
        institutions. (note on p.72)</p>
        <p>“Conventional views of globalization contain a
        ‘convergence hypothesis’ analogous in force, but
        considerably less san­ guine in implications, to an earlier
        one based on theories of industrialism (Kerr et al. 1960;
        Graubard 1964).” (Hall and Soskice 2001:73)</p>
        <p>Firms will not move activities off-shore due to the
        development of institional comparative advantages. (note on
        p.73)</p>
        <p>“Some scholars argue that the internationalization of
        trade and finance has not been as extensive or
        unprecedented as is often believed. Others argue that
        national governments are not as defenseless in the face of
        these developments as they appear, because governments have
        simply used international institutions or the excuse of
        global pressure to pursue reforms they wanted in any case
        (Wade 1996; Boyer 1996; Cohen 1996).” (Hall and Soskice
        2001:73)</p>
        <p>Contrafactuals to convergence hypothesis:
        internationalization is not so strong as expected;
        governments are not defenseless. (note on p.73)</p>
        <p>“firms in LMEs and CMEs develop distinctive strategies
        and struc­ tures to capitalize on the institutions
        available for market or non-market coordination in the
        economy.” (Hall and Soskice 2001:73)</p>
        <p>Firms in LME and CME are not similar and not becoming
        more alike. (note on p.73)</p>
        <p>“Second, our perspective suggests that firms will not
        automatically move their activities off-shore when offered
        low-cost labor abroad. Cheaper labor that comes with
        commensurate skill and productivity levels is always
        attractive, but firms also derive competitive advantages
        from the institutions in their home country that support
        specific types of interand intra-firm relationships.” (Hall
        and Soskice 2001:73)</p>
        <p>“Comparative institutional advan­ tages tend to render
        companies less mobile than theories that do not acknowledge
        them imply.” (Hall and Soskice 2001:73)</p>
        <p>In summary, comparative institutional advantages make
        firms less mobile as expected. (note on p.73)</p>
        <p>“Our concept of comparative institutional advantage also
        suggests that firms may exploit new opportunities for
        movement to engage in a form of institutional arbitrage. By
        this, we mean that companies may shift par­ ticular
        activities to other nations in order to secure the
        advantages that the institutional frameworks of their
        political economies offer for pursuing those activities”
        (Hall and Soskice 2001:74)</p>
        <p>Definition of institutional arbitrage: firms shifts
        parts of their activities to toher nations to secure
        advantages in that instituional sets (note on p.74)</p>
        <p>“Thus, companies may move some of their activities to
        liberal market economies, not simply to lower labor costs,
        but to secure access to institutional support for radical
        innovation.” (Hall and Soskice 2001:74)</p>
        <p>Exemple of institutional arbitrage. (note on p.74)</p>
        <p>“The result should be some weakening of organized labor
        and a substantial amount of deregulation, much as
        conventional views predict.” (Hall and Soskice 2001:74)</p>
        <p>There are some predicitions similar to conventional
        theory. (note on p.74)</p>
        <p>“Instead of the monolithic movement toward deregulation
        that many expect from globalization, our analysis predicts
        a bifurcated response marked by widespread deregulation in
        liberal market economies and limited movement in
        coordinated market economies.4o” (Hall and Soskice
        2001:75)</p>
        <p>VoC states a bifurcated prediction instead of a
        monolithic movement towards rederegulation. (note on
        p.75)</p>
        <p>“Deregulation has been far-reaching in the liberal
        market economies of Britain, the United States, New
        Zealand, Canada, and Australia but much less exten­ sive in
        the coordinated market economies of northern Europe” (Hall
        and Soskice 2001:76)</p>
        <p>In summaru, deregulation tendencies are stronger in LME
        than in CME. (note on p.76)</p>
        <p>“There is another side to globalization, however, with
        effects that some argue are more ambiguous. It lies in the
        pressures stemming from the internationalization of
        finance, where developments have recently been dramatic, if
        not unprecedented.” (Hall and Soskice 2001:77)</p>
        <p>The internationalization of <b>finance</b>, on the other
        side is unprecedented (note on p.77)</p>
        <p>“Therefore, firms seeking access to these funds face
        pressure to revise their accounting standards, appoint
        independent directors, and deliver the high rates of return
        associated with ‘shareholder value’.” (Hall and Soskice
        2001:77)</p>
        <p>Gravitation towards shareholder valorization. (note on
        p.77)</p>
        <p>“Similarly, some of the large banks and insurance
        companies in CMEs that once cultivated close relations with
        manufacturing firms have been disengaging from them in
        order to free up resources for global expan­ sion.” (Hall
        and Soskice 2001:78)</p>
        <p>CME banks vs finance internationalization (note on
        p.78)</p>
        <p>“These developments threaten traditional practices in
        CMEs in several ways. On the one hand, they could disrupt
        the intricate systems of cross­ shareholding and
        inter-corporate linkage that provide capacities for network
        monitoring, thereby reducing the access of firms to capital
        that is not tied to current profitability. On the other,
        they could force firms whose strategies and structure have
        reflected responsiveness to a wide range of stakeholders,
        including employees, to become more attentive to
        shareholders and rates of return; and this might reduce
        their capacity to make credible commitments to long-term
        collaborative relationships with other firms and
        employees.” (Hall and Soskice 2001:78)</p>
        <p>These changes threaten CMEs, however, they handle this
        problem in a CME manner. (note on p.78)</p>
        <p>“On one side are works that focus on institutions and
        the ways in which they reproduce stable patterns of
        behavior. Their relatively static view implies that
        national systems are unlikely to change very much in the
        face of globalization. On the other are works that
        attribute great force to the pressures associ­ ated with
        globalization. They tend to see national practices as
        inertial factors that will be transformed by these
        pressures.” (Hall and Soskice 2001:79)</p>
        <p>There are two versions of change:</p>
        <ol class="org-ol">
          <li>National systems are unlikely to change</li>
          <li>Glogalization make pressure to changes (note on

        </ol>
        <p>“We expect firms to respond with efforts to modify their
        practices so as to sustain their competitive advantages,
        including comparative institutional advantages. Thus, much
        of the adjustment process will be oriented to the
        institutional recrea­ tion of comparative advantage.” (Hall
