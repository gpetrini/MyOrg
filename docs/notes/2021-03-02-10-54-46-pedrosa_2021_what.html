        <p>“Several authors extended the FIH to other institutional
        sectors (e.g. Palley, 1994; Dutt, 2006; Isaac and Kim,
        2013; Ryoo, 2016; D’Orazio, 2019, for household debt;
        Nikolaidi, 2014 and Gimet et al. (2019) for bank-related
        dynamics). However, in Minsky’s view, the investment of
        non-financial corporations is the main culprit for economic
        fluctuations, as the aphorism by him quoted in Toporowski
        (2005) synthetically captures: ”investment determines
        output; finance determines investment“ (p. 143).” (Pedrosa
        and Lang 2021:45)</p>
        <p>FIH extended to other institutional sectors, but firms’
        investment is the main concern of Minky. (note on p.45)</p>
        <p>“There are, however, certain implications of Minsky’s
        theory that most interpreters would concur. An important
        one is the positively-sloped aggregate
        indebtedness-financial fragility curve (Delli Gatti and
        Gallegati, 1990; Pedrosa, 2019). This result arises
        precisely from the limitations of the selffinancing
        capacity of investment, resulting in a relative increase in
        debt-financing along with cycles’ upswing.” (Pedrosa and
        Lang 2021:45)</p>
        <p>One common-groun implication: positively-spoed aggregate
        indebtedness-financial fragility curve. (note on p.45)</p>
        <p>“The incorporation of more micro analysis into the FIH
        is justified to remedy its known potential weaknesses. As a
        starting point, in the FIH, financial fragility results
        from complex interactions between investment, cash flows,
        and debt” (Pedrosa and Lang 2021:46)</p>
        <p>Usually, the microanalysis of FIH potentialyze its
        weakness. (note on p.46)</p>
        <p>“Recently, some authors (Lavoie and Seccareccia, 2001;
        Toporowski, 2008; Bellofiore et al., 2010, among others)
        claimed that the FIH failed to incorporate adequately some
        of those feedbacks and descending implications, putting in
        jeopardy the validity of its corollaries: (i) the leverage
        ratio may not increase along with investment; (ii) the
        aggregate ratio may not be a good proxy of financial
        fragility, as Minsky himself suggested.” (Pedrosa and Lang
        2021:46)</p>
        <p>FIH fails to include some feedback. (note on p.46)</p>
        <p>“As argued by Kalecki (1954), an increase in investment
        expands profits - in Kaldor’s aphorism, capitalists earn
        what they spend - which invalidates the assumption of given
        cash flow. Consequently, the aggregate leverage can also be
        anti-cyclical: an increase in investment, even if
        debt-financed, can result in higher profits, fostering the
        accumulation of liquid assets (deposits) and leading to an
        ex-post decrease in the aggregate leverage. This is the
        case because the capacity of financing investment with
        retained profits improves.” (Pedrosa and Lang 2021:46)</p>
        <p>Minsky assumption is at odds with higher investment
        -&gt; higher profits. (note on p.46)</p>
        <p>“A second issue, raised by Toporowski (2008, 2012) and
        also related to Steindl (1952) discussions, is that the
        systemic financial fragility is not independent of the
        distribution of new liquidity that investment generates.
        This argument expands on the Kaleckian argument and centres
        on the role of firms’ heterogeneity. The main question it
        brings is who is getting the additional liquidity brought
        by the expanding investment. For instance, if the firms
        with higher growth are capturing sufficient profits, their
        expansion would not bring further fragility into the system
        because debt is moving more os less pari passu with
        financing needs.” (Pedrosa and Lang 2021:47)</p>
        <p>THe systemic financial fragiliti is not independt of the
        distribution of new liquidity. In other words, who get
        additional liquidity matters. (note on p.47)</p>
        <p>“The novelty of the paper in this regard is the
        exploration of the monetary implications of the Kaleckian
        profit equation in an FIH-AB-SFC model.” (Pedrosa and Lang

        macroeconomic results, we create a synthetic financial
        fragility index from Minsky’s financial fragility scale
        (hedge, speculative, and Ponzi) and develop an index
        inspired by Kakwani’s (1977) concentration index to measure
        joint profit-debt distribution. With these indices, we
        assess the impact of profit and debt joint-distributions (a
        meso characteristic) on the dynamics of the financial
        fragility of non-financial firms’.” (Pedrosa and Lang

        on the FIH. (note on p.47)</p>
        <p>“At the firm-level, once the internal funding capacity
        exhausts, higher investment requires higher debt, which
        entails certain future financial commitments. However, the
        new productive capacity yields uncertain future cash flows,
        potentially producing a mismatch between incoming money and
        the contractual debt servicing.” (Pedrosa and Lang

        <p>“The model features competition among firms, driven by
        attempts to increase labour productivity to reduce unit
        costs (Lee, 2013; Lavoie, 2014), through costly research
        and development (R&amp;D). R&amp;D is itself divided into
        trying to imitate competitors and to innovate (discovery of
        new technologies). The pricing decision follows a mark-up
        procedure, so firms closer to the technological frontier
        have lower unit costs, and those farther tend to struggle
        because they lack cost-competitiveness. In turn, the
        cost-competitiveness impacts both the market-price
        competitiveness and the mark-up, with two-fold implications
        for the profit rates.” (Pedrosa and Lang 2021:49)</p>
        <p>Fims R&amp;D -&gt; increase labour productivity;
        Cost-competitiveness impacts market-price competitiveness
        and mark-up in both ways. (note on p.49)</p>
        <p>“Secondly, the demand for each firm’s product depends on
        the relative prices: those with higher prices tend to lose
        market share (firms react by lowering their mark-up,
        squeezing their profit rates if their unit costs are high),
        while the ones with lower prices tend to gain market share,
        having room to increase the mark-up (and thus widen the
        profit rate, if their unit costs are low).” (Pedrosa and

        such variables on the investment ratio is typically small
        (Chirinko, 1993; Coad, 2009; Sharpe and Suarez, 2020). In
        our view, this casts considerable doubt on the use of
        financial variables as the key determinants of investment.

        of liquidity accumulation, which reduces the likelihood
        that a particular firm will need external funds in the

        have elevated cash disbursements to cover contractual
        financial obligations. Consequently, the tendency is to
        have a slower pace of liquidity accumulation because of the
        low level of free cash flows. Of course, between those two

        cover the debt servicing, pushing them towards speculative

        <p>“When the profit-debt index decreases, profits are
        becoming more concentrated within firms with very low (or

        to meet financial obligations. Since a substantial share of
        profits flows to firms with low financial commitments, the
        aggregate amount of free cash flows increases, accelerating
        the sector-wide pace of liquidity accumulation. However,
        less levered firms absorb much of the growth in liquidity.
        An implication of the liquidity growth is a considerable
        level of inertia: more liquidity translates into a low need
        for external funds to finance investment and production,

        proportionally more money, more likely providing means of
        debt validation. Conversely, it tends to go down when less
