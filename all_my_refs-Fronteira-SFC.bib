  abstract = {The present paper aims at offering a contribution to the understanding of the interactions between finance and inequality. We investigate the ways through which income and wealth inequality may have influenced the development of modern financial systems in advanced economies, the US economy first and foremost, and how modern financial systems have then fed back on income and wealth distribution. We focus in particular on securitization and on the production of complex structured financial products. We analyse this topic by elaborating a simulated hybrid Agent-Based Stock-Flow-Consistent (AB-SFC) macroeconomic model, encompassing heterogeneous (i.e. households) and aggregate sectors. Our findings suggest that the increase in economic growth, favoured by the higher level of credit supply coming with securitization, may determine a more unequal and financially unstable economic system.},

  abstract = {This work builds upon four different theoretical approaches: i. the Sraffian supermultiplier model; ii. the Schumpeterian framework of evolutionary economics that emphasises the entrepreneurial role of the State; iii. the `stock-flow consistent' approach to macroeconomic modelling; iv. recent developments in ecological economics literature aiming at cross-breeding post-Keynesian theories and models with more traditional `green' topics. Our main purpose is to develop a simple analytical tool that can help examine: a) the impact of government spending on private innovation; b) the impact of innovation on economic growth and the ecosystem; and c) the impact of ecological feedbacks on economic growth and government spending effectiveness. We find that, in principle, government can be successful in supporting innovation and growth while slowing down matter \& energy reserves' depletion rates and tackling climate change. However, the latter may well affect government policy effectiveness.},
