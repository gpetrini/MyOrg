#+title: Word count latex

Some ways to count the number of words in latex:

* Bash

#+begin_example bash
pdftotex file.pdf - | wc -c
#+end_example


* Builtin emacs function

In a =.tex= buffer, hit =M-x tex-count-words=

* Comparisons

- The bash alternative seems to overestimate the real number of words since include some words of references.
  Some journals do not include them
- Emacs builtin function count latex environment but not latex commands.
