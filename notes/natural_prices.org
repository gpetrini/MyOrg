* Smith definition presented in Petri (2021)

#+begin_quote
the prices of products called natural prices by Adam Smith, that is the hypothetical product prices that would result from competition having brought to completion its tendency to render rates of wages, rates of rent and rates of profits uniform in all industries.

...

Natural prices are a theoretical notion: the prices around which market prices gravitate, continually tending to come back to them after every deviation. This is because they are the prices that allow the payment of rent for the land used, the payment of wages to the labour employed, and the earning of profits on the capital advanced, at their normal rates in the given situation, rates that Smith called natural rates.
