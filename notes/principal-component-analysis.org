PCA separates the data into its structure and residual

- High percentage of inertia
  + Note: The variation of the second PC is not related to the first.
- Look for visible jump/gap in the barchart
- Cross-validation: =estim_ncp=

Looking to 10.000 PCA experiments with 4 independent variables and 100 individuals, 95% of the innertia obtained in the first 2 PC are less than 60.1%.
So, for an PCA with 4 variables and 100 individual, there is structure in the estimated model if the cummulative inertia explained is higher than 60.1% in the two PC.

** Transition formulas

- Individuals are on the same side as their corresponding variables with high variables

** Quality of representation ($cos^{2}$)

- co2 for individuals :: The higher, the better
  + cos2 close to one means that the angle is close to zero, so the point is well projected and the position of the point can be interpreted.
- co2 for variables :: The higher, the better

** Contributions to components

This element computes what contribute the most to some dimention.
So, if an individual or variable that contribute a lot (in %) it means that this dimension is composed mainly by this element.
Consequently, without this, that dimention would be quite different.

- Individuals with large coordinate contribute most
- Variables highly correlated with the principal component contribute the most

Thus, to evaluate the robustness of the estimation, remove the respective individual or variable and check how the dimension changed.

** Qualitative variables

First, a F-test is performed to check if the categorical variable is related to the dimention.
Next, for each category, a Student's t test is performed and compares the average of the category with the general mean.
Regarding the qualitative variable, it is calculated the variability ($R^{2}$ %) of the coordinates on the first dimention is explained by it.
In relation to the categorical variables, it is shown how each variables have a positive or negative coordination.
