** Sufficient conditions

*** Crisp-set

*Definition:* Whenever the condition is present across cases, the outcome is also present in these cases (p. 57)
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
X \subset Y
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
In venn diagram's terms, if ~X~ is a sufficient condition for ~Y~, the circle for ~X~ is fully contained (subset) in the circle of ~Y~:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
X \to Y
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
Thus, if $X$ is a sufficient condition, the following could not happen
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
X \to \neg Y
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
If ~X~ is a sufficient condition, cases with ~Y~ and *whithout* ~X~ are not expected.
Additionally, the condition ~~X~ is *irrelevant*  to state sufficiency for ~X~ due to the *asymmetry* in QCA.
In summary, the sufficiency of ~X~ is falsified if and only if there is *simultaneous* cases members of ~~X~ and ~Y~.

 #+BEGIN_latex

Additionally, all cases with non-zero membership score in the condition are relevant fot the test of sufficiency, _regardless of whether they are above or below 0.5_.

*Conclusion:* $\neg BC \to Y \hspace{2cm} AB \to \neg Y$

** Necessary conditions

*** Crisp sets

*Definition:* A condition ~X~ is necessary if, whenever the outcome ~Y~ is present, the condition is also present.
Thus, no cases with ~Y~ displays ~~X~; on the presence of ~~X~, ~Y~ is impossible.

For necessity, each case's fuzzy set membership score in $X$ must be equal or greater than its fuzzy-set membership in the outcome.
When it occur, $X$ is a superset of $Y$:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
X \supset Y

** Causal complexity in set-theoretic methods

- The number of cases should *not* be the central argument in favor of using QCA
  + QCA could be applied in studies with a large dataset
  + Theories and expectations about the underlying causal processes.

**** Defining causal complexity

Causal complexity has three main characteristics:

- *Equifinality:* presence of different, mutually non-exclusive path for the same phenomenon
  + Presence of sufficient but non-necessary condition implies equifinality
- *Conjunctural causation:* The effect of a single condition unfolds only in *combination* with other
  + Existence of necessary but non-sufficient condition implies conjunctural causation
- *Causal asymmetry:* The absence of an outcome is not necessarily equivalent to the negation of the condition that explains the presence of it.
  + DeMorgan's Law is not necessarily valid
    - To be testable, it is needed to include all possible combinations (no logical reminders)

**** INUS and SUIN conditions

*INUS:* *I* nsufficient but *N* ecessary parte of a condition which is itself *U* nnecessary but *S* ufficient for the result

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
AB + \neg BC + D\neg F \to Y
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
In this case, condition ~A~ is insufficient on its own but needed to form a sufficient conjunction together with ~B~.
The *sufficient* condition ~AB~ is not the only path to the outcome (/i.e./ it is unncecessary).

#+begin_example
Hint: if a condition occurs together with other to produce the outcome, but it is not the only path, so it is an INUS conditon.
#+end_example

*SUIN:* *S* ufficient, but *U* nnecessary part of a factor that is *I* nsufficient, but a *N* ecessary for the result.
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
(A+B)\cdot (C + \neg D) \leftarrow Y
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
In this case, there are two necessary conditions (A+B and C + ~D).
Eache one element alone of the condition is not necessary, but mutually substitutable elements of necessary conditions for Y.

* Chapter 4: Truth Tables
:PROPERTIES:
:PAGES:    91-115

** What is a truth table?

In a Truth Table (TT), each row represents one of the logically possible AND combinations between conditions.
The total number of rows is $2^{2}$ in which $k$ is the number of conditions.
Each row denotes a *qualitatively different* combination of conditions.

** How to get from a data matrix to truth table

*** Crip sets
1. Write down all $2^{k}$ logically possible combination
2. Assign each case to a TT row
   a. Each case can belong to only onele TT row, but each row can contain more than one case
3. Attribute to every TT row the outcome, which denotes *sufficiency*
   a. 1 indicates cases with given characteristics also show the outcome

*** Fuzzy sets

For fuzzy sets, it is usefull to consider the concept of *property space*.
Each set constitutes one dimension of the property space:
Based on set membership in the conditions, each case has one location in the *property space*[fn:: None condition should be calibrated as 0.5 to this results be valid.] which have $2^{k}$ corners that represents *ideal types*.
The crutial point is that, while each case has partial membership in all rows, the is only one row in which its membership exceeds the qualitative anchor of 0.5[fn::No matter how many fuzzy sets are combined as long as none of them is calibrated as 0.5 (maximum ambiguity).].

*MEMO:* Each TT row is a statement of sufficiency.
So, each TT row should considered a sufficient conjunction for the outcome if each case's membership in this row is smaller than or equal to its membership in the outcome.
Additionally, it is important to point out that this procedure does not involve any conversion of fuzzy-sets into crisp sets.

** Analyzing truth tables

*MEMO:* All rows that are linked to the outcome value of 1 are the *sufficient* conditions.
For the analysis of *necessity*, the bottom-up procedure has to be used.
However, the TT does not play an important role in the analysis of necessity.

*** Matching similar conjunctions

1. Create a Boolean expression of all those TT rows that are connected to the outcome to be explained.
   a. *Primitive expressions:* Conjuctions representing a TT row
2. This formula is the most complex way to express sufficiency
3. Start *logical minimization* (Quine-McCluskey algorithm)
   a. If two TT rows differ in only one condition, so this condition is /logically redundant/ and irrelevant for producing the outcome and thus can be *ommited*
      a. The result is called *prime implicant*
   b. The resultant formula is *logically equivalent* to the most complex formula and to all imtermediate formulas
4. Check if any primitive expression is covered by mor then one *prime implicant*. If so, it could be minimized again.
5. The final expression is (compared to the first one):
   a. Logically equivalent
   b. Express the same information contained in the TT
   c. Do noto contradict each other, nor do they contradict the information in the TT
   d. Summaries the empirical information

*** Logically redundant prime implicants

Prime implicants can be defined as the end products of the logical minimization process through pairwise comparisons of conjunctions.
A prime implicant is logically redundant if all of the primitive expressions are convred without it bein included in the solution formula.

*** Issues related to the analysis of the non-occurence of the outcome

In summary, set relations are *asymmetric* so the analysis for the non-occurence of the outcome could not be inferred from its presence.
Thus, the analysis should start again and another TT should be constructed.
As a reminder, DeMorgan's law is not necessarily valid and is only possible in a TT withot contraditions nor logical reminders.
It is worth mentioning that whenever a single condition is part of all sufficient path, then this condition must be *necessary* for the out come.
However, this conclusion is valid only if the suffiency analysis is performed on a *fully specified truth table*.

* Chapter 5: Parameters of fit
** Defining a dn dealing with contradictory truth table rows

Contradictory rows are those cases with same membership scores and *do not* share the same membership in outcome.
Thus, it cannot be included in the minimization procedure.
The following strategies could be employed in order to solve contradictions:

- *Adding a condition:* This procedure may remove the contradiction as long as cases differs in the new added condition
  + _CONS:_ Doubles the number of TT rows and increases the problem of *limited diversity*
- *Respecify the definition of the population of interest:* Some case could be excluded or added based on theoretical arguments and not in /ad hoc/ contradiction solving motivation
- *Respecify the outcome:* Recalibrating the outcome membership score may solve the contradiction, but this procedure must be theoretically driven

During the process of *minimization*, there are mutually exclusive treatments of logically contradictory rows:
- Exclude all of them
- Include all of them since it makes the occurrence of the outcome possible
  + _CONS:_ Covers cases that are not members of the outcome
  + Make all inconsistent rows available for computer-generated assumptions about their outcome value in order to make the solution term more parsimonious

Alternatively, it is possible to analyze how much, or to what degree, a given row deviates from a perfect set relation.
This is the rationale behind the consistency measure.
It is advisable to use consistency measure to guide wheter or not include a TT row into the logical minimization procedure.

** Consistency of sufficient conditions

The consistency of a sufficient condition $X$ for outcome $Y$ is mathematically expressed by dividing the numbers of cases where $X$ and $Y$ are present by the number of cases in which $X$ is present whether or not the outcome occurs.
The *raw consistency* is the consistency measure refers to the truth table rows while the *solution consistency* refers to the entire solution.
Thus, the crisp variant is:

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
Cons_{X,Y} = \frac{\text{Num. } X=1 \land \text{Num.} Y = 1}{\text{Num. } X=1}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
The crisp variant, however, is deficient since it gives equal weight to all cases below the diagonal.
In other words, the distance between cases ant the diagonal is not considered.

For fuzzy sets, the consistency measure is calculated as the sum of the minimum value across the membership score in $X$ and in $Y$ and divided by the sum of the membership values in $X$ across *all* cases:

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
Cons_{X \leq Y} = \frac{\sum \min{(X_{i}, Y_{i})}}{\sum X_{i}}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
Since considers all the cases, the fuzzy variant is more conservative and include how far the case is from the main diagonal.
However, there is one particular shortcoming: does not take into account whether an inconsistent case is above or beloe the qualitative anchor of 0.5 both in $X$ and/or $Y$.
Additionally, in fuzzy sets, not all inconsistent rows are automatically truly logically contradictory.

That been said, which consistency cut to choose?
The consistency threshold depend on the specific research context.
The more precisa and strong the theoretical expectations, the higher the consistency that should be used.
The lower the number of cases, the higher the consistency as well.

** Coverage of sufficient conditions

The *coverage* measure expresse the degree to which the consistent part of sufficiency condition $X$ overlaps with the outcome $Y$:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
Cov_{X,Y} = \frac{\text{Num. } X=1 \land \text{Num.} Y = 1}{\text{Num. } Y=1}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
The fuzzy-set equivalent is:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
Cov_{X \leq Y} = \frac{\sum \min{(X_{i}, Y_{i})}}{\sum Y_{i}}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
In summary, express how empirically important a subset relation is.
Conditions with low coverage cover only a little of the outcome of interest, but that little might be huge theoretical or substantive importance.
That is why there is no coverage threshold.

It is important to point that coverage *increases* due to cases that are inconsistent with the statement of sufficiency.
However, the coverage should be calculated for condition that have passed a threshold of consistency.

Similar to the consistency measure, the coverage of each path is called *raw coverage* (CovR) while the coverage of a specific path is called *unique coverage* (CovU) and the solution term leads to the *solution coverage*.
If there is no logically redundant path, all parts of the solution will have an *unique coverage* greater than zero.
If logically redundant prime implicant are included, the unique converage will be zero.
The CovU is calculated by subtracting from the solution coverage that is obtained by all paths except the one whose unique converage we are interested in.
Suposing the following solution:

#+begin_example
~A~C + ~BC + F~D
#+end_example
the unique converage will be:
#+begin_example
CovU (~A~C) = CovS - Cov(~BC + F~D)
#+end_example

** Consistency of necessary conditions

If a condition is necessary for the outcome, then no case may show the outcome without this condition.
Thus:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
Cons_{Nec, X,Y} = \frac{\text{Num. } X=1 \land \text{Num.} Y = 1}{\text{Num. } Y=1}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
while the fuzzy equivalent is:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
Cons_{X \geq Y} = \frac{\sum \min{(X_{i}, Y_{i})}}{\sum Y_{i}}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

It is important to check if true logical contradictory exists and not rely on consistent level.
For necessary conditions, a consistency threshold of at least 0.9 is advisable.

** Coverage of necessary conditions

The label coverage is misleading.
If $X$ has passed the consistency test as a necessary condition, thus

#+begin_quote
$X$ is a superset of $Y$ and thus $X$ fully covers $Y$.
In other words, by virtue of bein necessary, $X$ always fully covers all cases of membership in $Y$.
#+end_quote
In this sense, coverage of necessary conditions should be considered a measure of relevance or trivialness which crisp version is:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
Cov_{Nec. X,Y} = \frac{\text{Num. } X = 1 \land \text{Num. } Y = 1}{\text{Num. X = 1}}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
while the fuzzy-equivalent is
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
Cov_{Nec., X \geq Y} = \frac{\sum \min{(X,Y)}}{\sum X}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

Two points are worth mentioning about the coverage formula.
First, values for coverage necessity tend to be rather high.
Unlike coverage sufficiency, in research practice, values far below 0.5 are rare and those close to 0 hardly ever seen.
This suggests that when assessing the trivialness of necessary conditions, researchers should not be misled by seemingly high coverage values.

** Issues related to consistency and coverage :ATTACH:
- When using fuzzy-sets, we also advise paying close attention to which cases are true logical contradictions (TLC, see chapter 7), uniquely covered, and which one are not covered at all
- With sufficiency, very low coverage values indicates that only a small portion of the outcome of interest is explained by that condition
  + But could still be part of theoretical interest
- Higher consistency values often come at the price of lower coverage values
  + The more conditions that are combined, the more difficult membership it becomes
