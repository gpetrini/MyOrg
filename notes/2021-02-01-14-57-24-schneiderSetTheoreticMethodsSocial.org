** Sufficient conditions

*** Crisp-set

*Definition:* Whenever the condition is present across cases, the outcome is also present in these cases (p. 57)
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
X \subset Y
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
In venn diagram's terms, if ~X~ is a sufficient condition for ~Y~, the circle for ~X~ is fully contained (subset) in the circle of ~Y~:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
X \to Y
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
Thus, if $X$ is a sufficient condition, the following could not happen
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
X \to \neg Y
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
If ~X~ is a sufficient condition, cases with ~Y~ and *whithout* ~X~ are not expected.
Additionally, the condition ~~X~ is *irrelevant*  to state sufficiency for ~X~ due to the *asymmetry* in QCA.
In summary, the sufficiency of ~X~ is falsified if and only if there is *simultaneous* cases members of ~~X~ and ~Y~.

 For sufficiency, each case's fuzzy-set membership score in X must be equal to or smaller than its fuzzy-set membership in Y:
 #+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}

Additionally, all cases with non-zero membership score in the condition are relevant fot the test of sufficiency, _regardless of whether they are above or below 0.5_.

Similar to Crisp-sets, X must be a subset of outcome to be considered as a sufficient condition.

*Conclusion:* $\neg BC \to Y \hspace{2cm} AB \to \neg Y$

** Necessary conditions

*** Crisp sets

*Definition:* A condition ~X~ is necessary if, whenever the outcome ~Y~ is present, the condition is also present.
Thus, no cases with ~Y~ displays ~~X~; on the presence of ~~X~, ~Y~ is impossible.

For necessity, each case's fuzzy set membership score in $X$ must be equal or greater than its fuzzy-set membership in the outcome.
When it occur, $X$ is a superset of $Y$:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
X \supset Y
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
All cases with non-zero membership in outcome are relevant for the analysis of necessity.

** Causal complexity in set-theoretic methods

- The number of cases should *not* be the central argument in favor of using QCA
  + QCA could be applied in studies with a large dataset
  + Theories and expectations about the underlying causal processes.

**** Defining causal complexity

Causal complexity has three main characteristics:

- *Equifinality:* presence of different, mutually non-exclusive path for the same phenomenon
  + Presence of sufficient but non-necessary condition implies equifinality
- *Conjunctural causation:* The effect of a single condition unfolds only in *combination* with other
  + Existence of necessary but non-sufficient condition implies conjunctural causation
- *Causal asymmetry:* The absence of an outcome is not necessarily equivalent to the negation of the condition that explains the presence of it.
  + DeMorgan's Law is not necessarily valid
    - To be testable, it is needed to include all possible combinations (no logical reminders)

**** INUS and SUIN conditions

*INUS:* *I* nsufficient but *N* ecessary parte of a condition which is itself *U* nnecessary but *S* ufficient for the result

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
AB + \neg BC + D\neg F \to Y
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
In this case, condition ~A~ is insufficient on its own but needed to form a sufficient conjunction together with ~B~.
The *sufficient* condition ~AB~ is not the only path to the outcome (/i.e./ it is unncecessary).

#+begin_example
Hint: if a condition occurs together with other to produce the outcome, but it is not the only path, so it is an INUS conditon.
#+end_example

*SUIN:* *S* ufficient, but *U* nnecessary part of a factor that is *I* nsufficient, but a *N* ecessary for the result.
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
(A+B)\cdot (C + \neg D) \leftarrow Y
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
In this case, there are two necessary conditions (A+B and C + ~D).
Eache one element alone of the condition is not necessary, but mutually substitutable elements of necessary conditions for Y.

* Chapter 4: Truth Tables
:PROPERTIES:
:PAGES:    91-115

** What is a truth table?

In a Truth Table (TT), each row represents one of the logically possible AND combinations between conditions.
The total number of rows is $2^{2}$ in which $k$ is the number of conditions.
Each row denotes a *qualitatively different* combination of conditions.

** How to get from a data matrix to truth table

*** Crip sets
1. Write down all $2^{k}$ logically possible combination
2. Assign each case to a TT row
   a. Each case can belong to only onele TT row, but each row can contain more than one case
3. Attribute to every TT row the outcome, which denotes *sufficiency*
   a. 1 indicates cases with given characteristics also show the outcome

|-----+---+---+---+---+----+----------|

*** Fuzzy sets

For fuzzy sets, it is usefull to consider the concept of *property space*.
Each set constitutes one dimension of the property space:
Based on set membership in the conditions, each case has one location in the *property space*[fn:: None condition should be calibrated as 0.5 to this results be valid.] which have $2^{k}$ corners that represents *ideal types*.
The crutial point is that, while each case has partial membership in all rows, the is only one row in which its membership exceeds the qualitative anchor of 0.5[fn::No matter how many fuzzy sets are combined as long as none of them is calibrated as 0.5 (maximum ambiguity).].

*MEMO:* Each TT row is a statement of sufficiency.
So, each TT row should considered a sufficient conjunction for the outcome if each case's membership in this row is smaller than or equal to its membership in the outcome.
Additionally, it is important to point out that this procedure does not involve any conversion of fuzzy-sets into crisp sets.

** Analyzing truth tables

*MEMO:* All rows that are linked to the outcome value of 1 are the *sufficient* conditions.
For the analysis of *necessity*, the bottom-up procedure has to be used.
However, the TT does not play an important role in the analysis of necessity.

*** Matching similar conjunctions

1. Create a Boolean expression of all those TT rows that are connected to the outcome to be explained.
   a. *Primitive expressions:* Conjuctions representing a TT row
2. This formula is the most complex way to express sufficiency
3. Start *logical minimization* (Quine-McCluskey algorithm)
   a. If two TT rows differ in only one condition, so this condition is /logically redundant/ and irrelevant for producing the outcome and thus can be *ommited*
      a. The result is called *prime implicant*
   b. The resultant formula is *logically equivalent* to the most complex formula and to all imtermediate formulas
4. Check if any primitive expression is covered by mor then one *prime implicant*. If so, it could be minimized again.
5. The final expression is (compared to the first one):
   a. Logically equivalent
   b. Express the same information contained in the TT
   c. Do noto contradict each other, nor do they contradict the information in the TT
   d. Summaries the empirical information

*** Logically redundant prime implicants

Prime implicants can be defined as the end products of the logical minimization process through pairwise comparisons of conjunctions.
A prime implicant is logically redundant if all of the primitive expressions are convred without it bein included in the solution formula.

*** Issues related to the analysis of the non-occurence of the outcome

In summary, set relations are *asymmetric* so the analysis for the non-occurence of the outcome could not be inferred from its presence.
Thus, the analysis should start again and another TT should be constructed.
As a reminder, DeMorgan's law is not necessarily valid and is only possible in a TT withot contraditions nor logical reminders.
It is worth mentioning that whenever a single condition is part of all sufficient path, then this condition must be *necessary* for the out come.
However, this conclusion is valid only if the suffiency analysis is performed on a *fully specified truth table*.
