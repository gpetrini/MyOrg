According to [cite/t:@hommes_2021_Behavioral p. 156]:
#+begin_quote
One of the main general results form the adaptive learning literature is the Â­E-stability principle stating that an REE (i.e., a fixed point of the T-map) is locally stable under adaptive learning processes such as ordinary least squares (OLS), when it is a locally stable fixed point of the associated ordinary differential equation (ODE) [...] If an REE is not E-stable, then coordination of a large population of adaptive agents on such an equilibrium seems highly unlikely.
