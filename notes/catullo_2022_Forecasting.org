[cite/text:@catullo_2022_Forecasting;] present an macroeconomic [[id:9789613e-f409-4593-b958-a2c9c8283bb6][Agent Based Models]] in which firms employ [[id:62fb74a4-5187-4b8d-b0a9-54a5be4e6c84][Machine Learning]] algorithms to predict sales directions.
In general, they report than an improve in firms predictions increase profits, reducing wage-share and, long-run economic growth.
Those results are robust to the policy experiments (monetary and fiscal shock).

** Background and motivation

- Orthodox macroeconomic models  rely on [[id:a3dc72f3-bb99-4601-b58e-cc12229748f8][Rational Expectations]] hypothesis, which is not realistic.
  - There still room for heterodox models to improve and avoid [[id:f8c7d7dd-04ba-4abd-96a9-765b8260dfb4][Lucas' Critique]]
  - Besides there are some changes in orthodox models (such as [[id:88bb712d-d234-4e6c-a850-e3a55f5a30be][Learn to Forecast Experiments]]), they are still quasi-rational models since agents still maximize intertemporally
- It dialogues with [[id:d6b88985-00f9-44dd-bcfa-5033fea9e73e][Switching Mechanisms]], but do not employ them
- Some [[id:c41a871c-bfe1-470b-8c55-35650903af74][Experimental Finance]] papers provide evidence that simple heuristic rule outperform --- or explain agents behavior better --- compared to more sophisticated rule [cite:@anufriev_2012_Evolutionary;@hommes_2013_Behavioral]
  - In this direction, the paper are accordance with [cite/text:@dosi_2020_Rational] that more sophisticated rule imply worse macroeconomic performance

** Supporting Ideas and hypothesis

- This paper is based on a simplified version of [cite/text:@caiani_2019_Does] in which:
  - Wages update rule are simpler
- In each scenario, all firms follow the same behavioral rule
- It is a pure closed labour economy
  - So, there is no capital, and no investment
    - It is not possible to compare with other models
  - The model is "Wage-led"
- The number of firms and banks are endogenous and depends on households' capital contribution
- As in [cite/text:@caiani_2019_Does], firms updates sales and prices decisions based on stochastic procedures
- The innovative procedures follows [cite/text:@dosi_2010_Schumpeter]
- Each household can be employed by more than one firm
  - This was adopted to reduce computional cost
  - Workers that work in R&D receive extra wages
- Consumption decision depends both on disposable income and on financial wealth (banking deposits)
- Firms follow an monopolistic [[id:3e3db495-fc59-4816-bfde-8e54e6263aa1][Hotelling Competition]]
  - Households demand depends both on sensitivity on prices (related to preferences) and on distance
- Banks have a [[id:3486cdab-14b2-4f06-8078-bd93823f2640][Capital Requirement]] parameter and have a minimal reserve requirement
- Central Bank follow a [[id:576b10f4-300a-40b3-9764-3f1ae79c4054][Taylor Rule]]
- The entrant firm heritage the data of a randomly choose incumbent firm
- For some reason, the model starts with zero public and private resources
  - They argue that follows [cite:@godley_2007_Monetarya], in which credit creating allows economy to grow

** Purpose

- Analyze how more sophisticated prediction rules affect macroeconomic performance
  - Actually, this paper is more a proof-of-concept in order to propose a paper in which firms react to news, passing [[id:f8c7d7dd-04ba-4abd-96a9-765b8260dfb4][Lucas' Critique]]

** Contribution

- Improving behavioral rules is the next step in [[id:9789613e-f409-4593-b958-a2c9c8283bb6][Agent Based Models]] as a policy tool

** Relevance

- For the [[id:8d3c092d-8546-4dc0-8a04-55d3d8a09191][Dot-Com crisis]] chapter, this paper provide an dialog with [[id:9789613e-f409-4593-b958-a2c9c8283bb6][Agent Based Models]] that deals with [[id:8324a647-625d-4968-bc63-cf5209a2f1bf][Expectations formation and  Behavior macroeconomics]]
  -

** Methodology

- Macroeconomic [[id:9789613e-f409-4593-b958-a2c9c8283bb6][Agent Based Models]] in which firms employ [[id:62fb74a4-5187-4b8d-b0a9-54a5be4e6c84][Machine Learning]] algorithms regarding sales expectations
- The authors evaluate the *direction* of firms' sales expectations and not the exact value using Autoregressive and [[id:6761c999-7240-4954-b879-8d4cabdee9fc][Genetic Algorithm]] approach
  - The [[id:6761c999-7240-4954-b879-8d4cabdee9fc][Genetic Algorithm]] depends on firms' past sales, aggregate inflation and unemployment growth rates
  - Model is calibrated in order to generate zero means forecast errors
  - It could be argued that the [[id:ed384551-c7ba-492f-be69-15906157ef9d][Sraffian suppermultiplier growth model]] also related the investment decision to the direction of the aggregate demand ([[id:95265264-f61f-4cf5-8cdc-e590b2a47cb9][Innovation bubble ABM]])
- The experiments are:
  - Tight capital requirements ([[id:4e8f7eab-95dc-4e24-8268-d9875b9714b5][Macroprudential]] shock)
  - Decrease in public target deficit

** Results

- The negative shocks have persistent contrationary effects, but the prediction precision is high depending on the magnitude of the shock
- Changes in the market competition does not affect firms' forecast precision
- Using more sophisticated rules generates higher leverage, implying an economy more sensible to do exogenous shocks

** Interesting findings and not categorized stuff


- The monetary shock seems to have faster effects
  - This may be related to the banking credit duration
- For the [[id:95265264-f61f-4cf5-8cdc-e590b2a47cb9][Innovation bubble ABM]] chapter, it could be interesting to plot some aggregate variables according to the proportion of some heuristic rule in the x-axis (figure 10 in this paper)

** Critics

- Banking credit last for only one period. This may affect the results of the monetary shock
- Since all firms follow the same behavioral rule, there still room for my own contribution (endogenous heuristic emergence)
- The [[id:6761c999-7240-4954-b879-8d4cabdee9fc][Genetic Algorithm]] uses inputs that firms seems to not be so much attentive ([cite: see  @coibion_2018_How;])

** Abstract

#+BEGIN_ABSTRACT
The aim of this paper is to investigate how different degrees of sophistication in agents’ behavioral rules may affect individual and macroeconomic performances. In particular, we analyze the effects of introducing into an agent-based macro model firms that are able to formulate effective sales forecasts by using simple machine learning algorithms. These techniques are able to provide predictions that are unbiased and present a certain degree of accuracy, especially in the case of a genetic algorithm. We observe that machine learning allows firms to increase profits, though this result in a declining wage share and a smaller long-run growth rate. Moreover, the predictive methods are able to formulate expectations that remain unbiased when shocks are not massive, thus providing firms with forecasting capabilities that to a certain extent may be consistent with the Lucas Critique.

"The system modeled is a wage-led closed economy (Caiani et al., 2018; 2019a); therefore, a lower wage share tends to reduce the long-run growth trend" ([[zotero://select/library/items/2HPVD3WQ][Catullo et al., 2022, p. 2]]) ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H8DEA2CT?page=2&annotation=ATRS5JXQ][pdf]]) Model structure

"Mainstream macro models typically assume that agents are characterized by rational expectations (Muth, 1961)." ([[zotero://select/library/items/2HPVD3WQ][Catullo et al., 2022, p. 2]]) ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H8DEA2CT?page=2&annotation=JQ3VPNTI][pdf]]) [LITERATURE] Context

"which only partly deviate from the fully rational benchmark, perhaps underrating the macroeconomic implications of a different modeling of agents' behavior more in line with the original interpretation of bounded rationalit" ([[zotero://select/library/items/2HPVD3WQ][Catullo et al., 2022, p. 3]]) ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H8DEA2CT?page=3&annotation=TSY9BEX9][pdf]])

"Anufriev and Hommes (2012) show that a simple model of individual learning can explain these kind of aggregate regularities emerging in experimental data (see also Hommes, 2013, for a more general view): the model is based on evolutionary selection among heterogeneous expectation rules driven by their relative performance; in other words, agents can switch from a rule to another one based on the relative performance of each single rule" ([[zotero://select/library/items/2HPVD3WQ][Catullo et al., 2022, p. 3]]) ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H8DEA2CT?page=3&annotation=DKUT3WRT][pdf]]) Mention of rational heuristic rule

"Indeed, a sophisticated rule like recursive least squares give rise to less accurate individual predictions and worsen the macroeconomic performance, suggesting that rather than being rational, agents following “rational heuristics" may lead to more accurate individual forecasts and better aggregate result” ([[zotero://select/library/items/2HPVD3WQ][Catullo et al., 2022, p. 4]]) ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H8DEA2CT?page=4&annotation=4WUVLA8R][pdf]])

When we increase β the importance of prices decreased and thus the market becomes less competitive" ([[zotero://select/library/items/2HPVD3WQ][Catullo et al., 2022, p. 18]]) ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H8DEA2CT?page=18&annotation=5H8EBDUD][pdf]]) [EXPERIMENT]

"GA firms make higher profits; this results in a lower growth due to a reduced demand" ([[zotero://select/library/items/2HPVD3WQ][Catullo et al., 2022, p. 18]]) ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H8DEA2CT?page=18&annotation=WYPMTAFR][pdf]]) [RESULT]

"Changing the level of competitiveness does not impact on the predictive performance under fiscal shocks" ([[zotero://select/library/items/2HPVD3WQ][Catullo et al., 2022, p. 18]]) ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H8DEA2CT?page=18&annotation=Z5LB3YU7][pdf]]) [RESULT] ([[zotero://select/library/items/2HPVD3WQ][Catullo et al., 2022, p. 19]]) {PLOT] Possible plot: x-axis with the proportion of firms with an specific expectational rule.

"While, considering macroprudential shocks, when competitiveness raises (β = 0.2) the effectiveness of the predictive method slightly decline" ([[zotero://select/library/items/2HPVD3WQ][Catullo et al., 2022, p. 20]]) ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H8DEA2CT?page=20&annotation=RSQH59RE][pdf]])

"Larger size causes a reduction of the number of firms, thus competition among firms becomes weaker and firms see their profits increase with respect to wages" ([[zotero://select/library/items/2HPVD3WQ][Catullo et al., 2022, p. 20]]) ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H8DEA2CT?page=20&annotation=K756X73X][pdf]]) [RESULT]

"In this last case, agents tend to have higher leverage, so they are more affected by restrictive macroprudential measures" ([[zotero://select/library/items/2HPVD3WQ][Catullo et al., 2022, p. 20]]) ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H8DEA2CT?page=20&annotation=8RHNDB6B][pdf]])
