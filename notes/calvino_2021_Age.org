[cite/t:@calvino_2021_Age] analyze the age log-distribution of French firms.
In summary, report that a [[id:8cdf72ff-1db7-49f8-8d7e-d0d903ff6865][Geometric Law of Distribution]] is a good first approximation for aggregate age distribution; declining [[id:eaa94f65-0764-47fd-b3b5-89741fa51dda][Firm entry rate]]s and a lower probability to survival of young firms.
More specific results highlight the deviating from the benchmark geometric distribution related to sectoral heterogeneity and different stages of sectoral life-cycle


** Background and motivation

- Few attention is given for firms' age distribution
- Young firms are one of the sources of [[id:8a78794f-08bc-4a01-a176-599aeea1a679][Creative Destruction]] and radical [[id:8651d790-2079-4233-b8ba-a01e1ada53e8][Technological revolution]]

** Supporting Ideas and hypothesis

- Literature discuss the fitness of [[id:8cdf72ff-1db7-49f8-8d7e-d0d903ff6865][Geometric Law of Distribution]] in which the probability of survivor decrease over time
  - There are more young firms than old one
  - Formally, the frequency of firms with age $age$ can be described as $log(count_{i}) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}age_{i} + \varepsilon_{i}$ in which $\beta_{1}$ is expected to be negative
- [[id:eaa94f65-0764-47fd-b3b5-89741fa51dda][Firm entry rate]]s change during the sector life-cycle [cite:@klepper_1996_Entry]
  - At the begining of life-cycle, there are a higher rate of entrants with more [[id:4db8e3cd-585a-435b-ae6a-df903e5bf7af][Product Innovation]] with changing market-share
  - In more mature sectors, in which the leader are more stablished, there is a lower entry level with more [[id:0c6c78fd-8d22-4002-9c82-7ccd82af43f5][Process Innovation]]

** Purpose

The purpose of this paper is to provide a better understanding of distribution of firms' ages.


** Contribution

- This paper estimate an empirical model considering a new dataset for French first which collects the information of all existing firms
- This paper provide some evidence that allows to discuss in more depth the role of [[id:e40b4e38-246e-4c64-a159-83e811029644][New Entrant]]s in the industrial dynamics
- Additionally, undertande the firms' age distribution allows to a better description for a sector life-cycle

** Relevance

For the [[id:95265264-f61f-4cf5-8cdc-e590b2a47cb9][Innovation bubble ABM]] chapter, this paper may provide some evidence regarding the convergence of capacity utilization rate to the normal level as suggested by [[id:a757b53b-d6e4-4e3f-9ddb-3d139686d392][PhD Dissertation Discussions]].
Other relevant aspect relates the sector life-cycle and the frequency of [[id:0c6c78fd-8d22-4002-9c82-7ccd82af43f5][Process Innovation]] and [[id:4db8e3cd-585a-435b-ae6a-df903e5bf7af][Product Innovation]].

** Methodology

The author estimate an empirical model for France for 2008 (metropolitan area only and focusing on manufacturing and non-financial firms) and present an stochastic model in order to replicate the reported [[id:8e9dd4a4-0f29-46d1-b8e4-5befe4df94cb][Stylized Facts]].
In the theoretical model, the author allows the possibility of firms entry and adds stochastic exit.
Firm's age is supposed to be an emergent propriety determined by [[id:eaa94f65-0764-47fd-b3b5-89741fa51dda][Firm entry rate]]


** Results

The main result is the decline of [[id:eaa94f65-0764-47fd-b3b5-89741fa51dda][Firm entry rate]] with a lower probability of survivor of [[id:e40b4e38-246e-4c64-a159-83e811029644][New Entrant]]s (younger firms).
The analytical model replicates the main [[id:8e9dd4a4-0f29-46d1-b8e4-5befe4df94cb][Stylized Facts]] reported by the author:
- [[id:8cdf72ff-1db7-49f8-8d7e-d0d903ff6865][Geometric Law of Distribution]] is a good first approximation to describe aggregate age distribution
- There are some deviation from the [[id:8cdf72ff-1db7-49f8-8d7e-d0d903ff6865][Geometric Law of Distribution]] in the aggregate level regarding firm ages (there are some breaks associated with historical episodes such as [[id:8121729f-1246-48f7-b8ff-5539223c1f32][Great Moderation]], [[id:a43aa39b-c318-4e35-9b9b-3557ce6a4b86][Great Depression]] and [[id:b0e0ff42-d4fd-4fea-bace-219ee43cb5df][I and II World Wars]])
  - There is a flatter distribution of firms with 1-30 years and a steeper one for 30-50 years firms
- In the more granular level, there are considerable heterogeneity of the log-distribution, deviating from the benchmark [[id:8cdf72ff-1db7-49f8-8d7e-d0d903ff6865][Geometric Law of Distribution]]
  - Those distinction may be related to different life-cycle of each sector
  - The more desegregated the data are, worse is the quality of the geometric fit
  - The stage of the life-cycle of each sector affects economy's aggregage age log-distribution
- It is reasonable to consider a constant entry rate (round 12%)
- The structural break regarding firms's age distribution seems to be related to the lower survival of younger firms

Considering the theoretical model:
- Higher survival probability (keeping entry rate constant) does not change the distribution slope and similar results is found for a lower survival probability

** Interesting findings and not categorized stuff

- Similar declines in the [[id:eaa94f65-0764-47fd-b3b5-89741fa51dda][Firm entry rate]] are reported for other countries
- Supposing that age distribution follows [[id:8cdf72ff-1db7-49f8-8d7e-d0d903ff6865][Geometric Law of Distribution]], younger firms are better fitted in the regression comparing older ones
- The author also disccusses the implications for employment in which points out that sectors in the early-phases of the life-cycle are more labor-friendly

** Critics


** Abstract

#+BEGIN_ABSTRACT
We investigate upon the shape and the determinants of the age distribution of business firms. By employing a novel dataset covering the population of French businesses, we highlight that a geometric law provides a reasonable approximation for the age distribution. However, relevant systematic deviations and sectoral heterogeneity appear. We develop a stochastic model of firm dynamics to explain the mechanisms behind this evidence and relate them to business dynamism. Results reveal a long-term decline in entry rates and lower survival probabilities of young firms. Our findings bear important implications for aggregate outcomes, notably employment growth.
