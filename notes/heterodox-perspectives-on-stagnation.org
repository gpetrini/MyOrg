* Stefano Di Bucchianico (Roma Tre): Inequality, household debt, ageing and bubbles: A model of demand-side Secular Stagnation

** Rediscovery of Secular Stagnation

- Slowdown of the population growth
- Income inequality
- Deleveraging
- Financial bubbles

** Negative interest rate policy

Some PK questioned the natural rate of interest:
- existence of a natural rate of interest
- Internal critique: negative natural rate of interest is not consistent
  + Cannot be used in neoclassical models

** Proposal

- Present a model in which all the previous elements is present without including natural rate of interest

** Alternative model

- Inequality and household debt:
  + Workers react to discrepancies between current and target consumption level
  + Differentiaite the number of people in each social class (Workers, Managers and Capitalists)

g^{C^{aw}} = g^{em} + g^{b^{w}}

Stability:

Now, consumption depends on the emulation effect and house price, while house prices depends on discrepancies between supply and demand and on credit.
