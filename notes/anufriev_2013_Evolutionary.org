| *Results*                                     | In negative feedback markets, adaptive rule performs better and expectations converts quickly to the fundamentals; in positive feedback market, trending-following provide better results.

| *5SS*                                         | This paper provide a general framework which report both positive and negative feedback markets. In summary, agents use a simple heuristic rule and change it accordingly to its performance. This approach fit the laboratory data very well, is robust and only needs to specify three parameters.             |

** Abstract

#+BEGIN_ABSTRACT
An economic environment is a feedback system, where the dynamics of aggregate variables depend on individual expectations and vice versa. The type of feedback mechanism is crucial for the aggregate outcome. Experiments with human subjects (Heemeijer et~al., J Econ Dyn Control 33:1052â€“1072, 2009) have shown that price converges to the fundamental level in a negative feedback environment but fails to do so under positive feedback. We present an explanation of these experimental results by means of a model of evolutionary switching between heuristics. Active heuristics are chosen endogenously, on the basis of their past performance. Under negative feedback an adaptive heuristic dominates explaining fast price convergence, whereas under positive feedback a trend-following heuristic dominates resulting in persistent price deviations and oscillations.

* Specific notes



** First-order heuristics

In this simple version of [cite/t:@anufriev_2012_Evolutionarya], the authors propose two types of [[id:cdc7d683-cbb8-4611-805c-0e058411c9e2][Learning and Heuristics]]:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
\tag{adaptative}
x^{e}_{t+1} = \omega x_{t} + (1-\omega)x_{t}^{e}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
\tag{Trending}
x^{e}_{t+1} = x_{t} + \gamma (x_{t} - x_{t-1})
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
in which $x$ is the variable of interest (asset price, in this case); $\omega$ and $\gamma$ are weight parameters.


** Heuristic switching model

Each heuristic ($h$) is evaluated regarding its past performance ($U$):
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
U_{h,t} = -(x_{t} - x^{e}_{h,t})^{2} + \eta U_{h,t-1}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
in which $\eta$ is a persistency parameter.

The share of heuristic ($n_{h}$) changes according to:
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
n_{h,t+1} = \delta n_{t} + (1-\delta)\frac{\exp(\beta U_{h})}{\sum_{h=1}^{H}\exp{\beta U_{h,t}}}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
in which $\delta$ is a memory parameter while $\beta$ is a intensity parameter. Accordingly to the authors (p. 674):
#+begin_quote
Positive values of $\delta$ capture the tendency of people to stick to their previously chosen rule despite the evidence that an alternative rule performs better. Such inertia is widely reported in experiments (Kahneman 2003) [...]
If $\beta=0$ agents will not consider the differences in the performance of the heuristics at all; all heuristics will be given equal impacts.
