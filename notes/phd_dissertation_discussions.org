* Introduction

This node is an archive for discussed topics regarding my PhD Dissertation.
Most of them are meeting notes.

* General topics

** Hypothesis

- How to model workers productivity?
  - Is it reasonable to suppose that we are modeling households and not workers?
  - Populational growth make simulations dificult

* [[id:95265264-f61f-4cf5-8cdc-e590b2a47cb9][Innovation bubble ABM]]


** Possible topics

- Decide whether to focus on innovation of process (easier) or in products (most promissory)
  - Indicate future research agenda in the conclusion
- Firm entry and exit could generate flexible investment share
- Structural break as a source of composition fallacy
  - Firm only knows its mean productivity, not for the whole economy
- Include market-share expectation
  - Firms do not know others' market-sahre, but may have an expectation about its own share
  - Check [cite/t:@caiani_2016_Agent]
- Dialogue with [cite/t:@nomaler_2021_Dbased]
- Check which stylized facts do the KS model do not replicate
- The dot-com crisis is an evidence that autonomous investment could not lead the business cycle harmless
- Read more about Carlota Perez (innovation)
- Check usefull bubbles [cite:@eatwell_2004_Usefull]
- Present the limitation about asset bubbles


** Model design



*** STRT Bank pointers
*** Financial housekeeping

- Amortization schedule is define in the first year of loan creation
  - It is assumed an constant amortization schedule
- Amortization due is the amount that an agent must pay to bank and it could contrast with amortization schedule when there is not enough income
  - This is why to separate these two variables
- Amortization flow is used by banks to accumulate the received amortization payment

*** TODO Define how to estimate household leverage

- Market-base includes asset price change (may be interesting for the model with housing)
- Book-leverage (for firms, at least) does not include asset price change

*** TODO Bank benchmark interest rate

- Discuss which interest rate bank consider as it benchmark
  - This is an behavioral equation
  - Could the the average interest rate with different spread or an spread in the policy rate

*** TODO Household probability to default

- Each household have a probability to default according to the number of financial instruments
- Implement an LSD =FUNCTION=
  - Adds a flag if it have or not a colateral
  - Value must be overwritten

*** TODO Household exit and foreclosure

- Households do not leave the market. They still offer it labour force
- There is no necessity to add an specific capital contribution to them
- When foreclosure is implemented, the property of an asset (possibly houses) should change
- During foreclosure procedure, it is required to define the order of default payment. This is a theoretical issue.
  - The same applies for credit contraint

*** WAIT Household financial stability

- Household income debt distribution index should use ...

*** WAIT Accounting

- When GDP supply and Demand does not hold, it is deducted from ???


*** WAIT Sectoral divergence

- Averages
  - Competitiveness
  - Mark-up
- Revision and rebase
  - Market-share
  - Sales
- Financial fragility index
- Capacity utilization
- Desired and effective production

*** WAIT Initialization

- Variables to be estimated were defined according to:
- Model calibration:

** Hypothesis


- The most important aspect of the model design regards the expectational mechanism
  - Present a modeling strategy in which agents persists investing more even though its market-share shrinks
    - Possibly imposing a larger investment plan horizon
  - Firms merge expectations regarding the whole economy with its own sector
  - The sum of market-share could not but greater than one
- Households should have financial relations with only one bank?


** Analysis

*** Ad hoc expectational shock


In general, there is no persistent effects in terms of economic growth or regarding market structure.

- The main effects are related to financial status of firms.
- During the shock, there are more minskian firms and an increase in the share of Ponzi units.
  - In the SSM scenario, minskian firms share converges to one and this trajectory does not change during the shock
  - In the Kaleckian scenario, there is an increase in Ponzi units, but it decreases after the shock ceases
- As expected, aggregate expected market-share is more than one.
- Apparently, there is no significative firm entry-exit changes. Mean and median firms age remains the same after the shock. There is no structural break.
- Investment lumpiness in the Kaleckian scenario remains the same while in the SSM scenario higher accumulation growth rates dominate
- There are more Ponzi and speculative units in the SSM scenario
- There are no significative change in technology-related variables such as productivity distribution
- Capacity utilization rate is more volatile in both scenarios during shock.
  - In the SSM scenario, it seems to have a non-stationary trend
- At the end of simulation, aggregate sales bias is negative. Probably related to adaptative expectation rule that understatimate effective sales.
- Credit rationing and floating banking interest rate have similar effects
  - More minskian firms at the beginning of the shock
  - Investment lumpiness is similar to baseline
  - The only difference is the lower firms' in the floating interest rate scenario
  - Temporarily higher Ponzi unit during the shock and a lower value after shock ends
  - Capacity utilization rate has a higher amplitude
    - It seems to have a persistently lower capacity utilization after shock in floating interest rate scenario


** Implementation

*** First version questions <2022-01-14 sex>

**** Credit
- How to use =COUNT_HOOK= for bank to access household loans?
  - How to add households loans in bank total credit supply equation?
  - HOOK dentro da instância de crédito



**** Entry and exit
- Which inventory variable to use when exiting?
  - I assume it is end of period
- While creating hooks between banks and firms, the count hook procedure includes households and need to change?

**** Initialization

- Firms opening, post-sales, post-production, post-credit and end-period should be the same?
  - Same question for firms deposits
- Considering Reissl (2020), etaf in mkks is the beta1 in Reissl?
  - It is required to estimate an SS value for households as well?
- It is required to estimate household debt service as in firms?
  - It is required to estimate a new etaf?

* Housing AB model

** General topics

- Check whether a finite housing demand is not incompatible with a infinite labor supply
- Explicitly present how house prices affects the whole economy
- Add Varieties of residential capitalism diagram discussion

** Model design


- Construction sector aggregate
- Finite demand for housing is not compatible with infinity households
- Try different interest rates


*** Houses instances


- Houses should be at the same level as HOUSEHOLDS and FIRMS
- Include an flag to indicate if the house is fully built; If so, change its owner
- It is possible to use static hooks for houses since it will not change

*** Foreclosure procedure

** Hypothesis

- How do households choose among houses and financial assets?
- How do households decide where and when to move out?
  - Rent above some threshould?
- Do rich households buy houses with High Powered Cash?
- Does the houses own rate of interest is a macro or microeconomic result?

** Possible Topics


- Allow govern expenditure grow at a different rate and induce financial instability endogenously
  - Allow more scenarios (not only related to households)
- Credit cycle is not endogenous if asset bubbles are exogenous
- Discuss residential investment inclusion in other ABM

* Spatial housing AB model

** Model design

- Is a fixed grid size incompatible with speculation as a results of speculation with land?
