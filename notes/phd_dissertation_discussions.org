* Introduction

This node is an archive for discussed topics regarding my PhD Dissertation.
Most of them are meeting notes.

* General topics

** Hypothesis

- How to model workers productivity?
  - Is it reasonable to suppose that we are modeling households and not workers?
  - Populational growth make simulations dificult

* [[id:95265264-f61f-4cf5-8cdc-e590b2a47cb9][Innovation bubble ABM]]


** Possible topics

- Decide whether to focus on innovation of process (easier) or in products (most promissory)
  - Indicate future research agenda in the conclusion
- Firm entry and exit could generate flexible investment share
- Structural break as a source of composition fallacy
  - Firm only knows its mean productivity, not for the whole economy
- Include market-share expectation
  - Firms do not know others' market-sahre, but may have an expectation about its own share
  - Check [cite/t:@caiani_2016_Agent]
- Dialogue with [cite/t:@nomaler_2021_Dbased]
- Check which stylized facts do the KS model do not replicate
- The dot-com crisis is an evidence that autonomous investment could not lead the business cycle harmless
- Read more about Carlota Perez (innovation)
- Check usefull bubbles [cite:@eatwell_2004_Usefull]
- Present the limitation about asset bubbles


** Model design


** Hypothesis


- The most important aspect of the model design regards the expectational mechanism
  - Present a modeling strategy in which agents persists investing more even though its market-share shrinks
    - Possibly imposing a larger investment plan horizon
  - Firms merge expectations regarding the whole economy with its own sector
  - The sum of market-share could not but greater than one

** Implementation

*** First version questions

**** Which inventory variable should use?

***** =Post_Production_Inventory= Equation

***** Check which inventory in =End_Period_Inventory=
***** Check which inventory in =End_Period_Inventory=
***** ==__Check_Inventories= Equation
**** Deflation and pricing
***** In =Expansion_Investment= Equation, Capital goods should be deflated but =Capital_Goods_Price=?
***** What is the difference between =Capital_Goods_Price= and price of the capital object =Capital_Obj_Price=
**** Pointers
***** =Nominal_Wage= should be at root or root -> next?
**** Capital and innovation

- Equation =Capital_Quantity= returns a lagged value. Does it means that when a lagged capital variable is used in another equation it is actually t-2?
- Should the =Technological_Frontier= be the same across sectors?
  - The same goes for =__Imitation= and =__Innovation=
- Is the maximum capital growth rate based on a empirical reference?
- Why in =Innovation_Workers= Equation the value is set to =RD_Workers= when is at the technological frontier?
- =RD_Workers= Equation should be applied to all firms?
**** Credit

- Credit loans should be under bank or firms/households respectively?
- Since [cite/t:@pedrosa_2021_What] model only have credit to firms, =Expected_Return_Consumption_Loan= should be similar to firm loans?
  - And this should be the same for mortgage loan?
  - What are the differences between =__idBank= and =__BankID= (=idBank= in the original)
- How to include mortgages?
- Which level for =__Bank_Draw= Equation?
**** Production


**** Accounting

- Household consumption that defines its NFW should be nominal or real?
- Should =Houlsehold_Opening_Deposits= include amortisation and interest deduction?
**** General

- Set parameters values programatically
- It is fine to use =Variable = float V("Variable")=?

* Housing AB model

** General topics

- Check whether a finite housing demand is not incompatible with a infinite labor supply
- Explicitly present how house prices affects the whole economy

** Model design


- Construction sector aggregate
- Finite demand for housing is not compatible with infinity households
- Try different interest rates

** Hypothesis

- How do households choose among houses and financial assets?
- How do households decide where and when to move out?
  - Rent above some threshould?
- Do rich households buy houses with High Powered Cash?
- Does the houses own rate of interest is a macro or microeconomic result?

** Possible Topics


- Allow govern expenditure grow at a different rate and induce financial instability endogenously
  - Allow more scenarios (not only related to households)
- Credit cycle is not endogenous if asset bubbles are exogenous
- Discuss residential investment inclusion in other ABM

* Spatial housing AB model

** Model design

- Is a fixed grid size incompatible with speculation as a results of speculation with land?
