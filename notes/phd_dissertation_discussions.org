* Introduction

This node is an archive for discussed topics regarding my PhD Dissertation.
Most of them are meeting notes.

* General topics

** Hypothesis

- How to model workers productivity?
  - Is it reasonable to suppose that we are modeling households and not workers?
  - Populational growth make simulations dificult

* [[id:95265264-f61f-4cf5-8cdc-e590b2a47cb9][Innovation bubble ABM]]


** Possible topics

- Decide whether to focus on innovation of process (easier) or in products (most promissory)
  - Indicate future research agenda in the conclusion
- Firm entry and exit could generate flexible investment share
- Structural break as a source of composition fallacy
  - Firm only knows its mean productivity, not for the whole economy
- Include market-share expectation
  - Firms do not know others' market-sahre, but may have an expectation about its own share
  - Check [cite/t:@caiani_2016_Agent]
- Dialogue with [cite/t:@nomaler_2021_Dbased]
- Check which stylized facts do the KS model do not replicate
- The dot-com crisis is an evidence that autonomous investment could not lead the business cycle harmless
- Read more about Carlota Perez (innovation)
- Check usefull bubbles [cite:@eatwell_2004_Usefull]
- Present the limitation about asset bubbles


** Model design


** Hypothesis


- The most important aspect of the model design regards the expectational mechanism
  - Present a modeling strategy in which agents persists investing more even though its market-share shrinks
    - Possibly imposing a larger investment plan horizon
  - Firms merge expectations regarding the whole economy with its own sector
  - The sum of market-share could not but greater than one
- Households should have financial relations with only one bank?

** Implementation

**** Credit
- What the difference between amortisation schedule, amortisation due, amortisation flow?
- How to aggregate leverage? Total debt to total asset ratio or some other weight?
- How does more than a loan change bank averate interest rate equation?
- How to define household interest payment? Similar to firms?
  - Same to mortgage?
- How to calculate average interest rate?
- Check household housekeeping debt servicing procedure
- How to use =COUNT_HOOK= for bank to access household loans?
  - How to add household id?
  - How to add households loans in bank total credity supply equation?
- How to estimate household probability to default when there is more than one loan?
- What to do next after household are credit constrained? Prioritize some kind of loan?
  - Banks grants consumption loans and then mortgage loans?
  - Banks consider household gross or disposable income?
- Should household interest rate be the same for mortgage and consumption loans?
- Household income debt distribution index should use which variable?
  - Current version uses disposable income
- Households consumption loan change should use outstanding loan value or other variable?
- Is DebtToSalesRatio correct in mkks?
- In floating interest rate, aggred interest rate is the last interest rate proposed by bank to the firm?

**** Accounting and aggregates

- How to deduct household consumption to close GDP accounting when households are heterogeneous?
- How to specify households end-of-period deposits? Using a fixing share? Residual variable?
- How to check unfilled demand accounting with more than one sector?
  - Same question for firm financial status incidence
- Firm's competitiveness should be different between sectors?
  - Firm's average competitiveness should use market or economy share?
- How to check market share accounting with more than one sector? And how to update it?
  - Same goes to market share rebase
- How to implement revision firm sales with more than one sector?
- Average markkup should have sectoral heterogeinity?
- Aggregate firm productivity should follow economy or market-share?
- Should firms financial fragility index have sectoral heterogeinity?

**** Capital and Production (related to sectoral divergence)

- Aggregate capacity utilization should include only consumption goods sector?
  - Hypothesis: Yes
- Firms desired production should have sectoral divergence?
  - Same question for effective production
  - Same question for investment variables
- Post production inventory should be opening or end-of-period deposits?
  - Current version: lagged end-of-period inventories
  - In sales equation, should be opening inventories or post production?

**** Entry and exit
- Household exit mechanism should be activated in the homogenous household version?
  - Which contribution variable to generate?
  - What to do with houses when households exit?
  - How does it change household financial wealth accounting?
- Is hooks count still valid when households loans is active?
- Which inventory variable to use when exiting?
  - I assume it is end of period
- While creating hooks between banks and firms, the count hook procedure includes households and need to change?
- Regarding households entry
  - Which variable to be set at the initial time?

**** General

- When CYCLE is required to get the SUM?
- If all code is in a single file, LSD IDE can get description, variable use and used in?

**** WAIT Houses

- Where to define houses?
- Which housekeeping to add?
- How to hook to bank, household and builder?

* Housing AB model

** General topics

- Check whether a finite housing demand is not incompatible with a infinite labor supply
- Explicitly present how house prices affects the whole economy
- Add Varieties of residential capitalism diagram discussion

** Model design


- Construction sector aggregate
- Finite demand for housing is not compatible with infinity households
- Try different interest rates

** Hypothesis

- How do households choose among houses and financial assets?
- How do households decide where and when to move out?
  - Rent above some threshould?
- Do rich households buy houses with High Powered Cash?
- Does the houses own rate of interest is a macro or microeconomic result?

** Possible Topics


- Allow govern expenditure grow at a different rate and induce financial instability endogenously
  - Allow more scenarios (not only related to households)
- Credit cycle is not endogenous if asset bubbles are exogenous
- Discuss residential investment inclusion in other ABM

* Spatial housing AB model

** Model design

- Is a fixed grid size incompatible with speculation as a results of speculation with land?
