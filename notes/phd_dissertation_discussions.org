* Introduction

This node is an archive for discussed topics regarding my PhD Dissertation.
Most of them are meeting notes.

* General topics

** Hypothesis

- How to model workers productivity?
  - Is it reasonable to suppose that we are modeling households and not workers?
  - Populational growth make simulations dificult

* [[id:95265264-f61f-4cf5-8cdc-e590b2a47cb9][Innovation bubble ABM]]


** Possible topics

- Decide whether to focus on innovation of process (easier) or in products (most promissory)
  - Indicate future research agenda in the conclusion
- Firm entry and exit could generate flexible investment share
- Structural break as a source of composition fallacy
  - Firm only knows its mean productivity, not for the whole economy
- Include market-share expectation
  - Firms do not know others' market-sahre, but may have an expectation about its own share
  - Check [cite/t:@caiani_2016_Agent]
- Dialogue with [cite/t:@nomaler_2021_Dbased]
- Check which stylized facts do the KS model do not replicate
- The dot-com crisis is an evidence that autonomous investment could not lead the business cycle harmless
- Read more about Carlota Perez (innovation)
- Check usefull bubbles [cite:@eatwell_2004_Usefull]
- Present the limitation about asset bubbles


** Model design


** Hypothesis


- The most important aspect of the model design regards the expectational mechanism
  - Present a modeling strategy in which agents persists investing more even though its market-share shrinks
    - Possibly imposing a larger investment plan horizon
  - Firms merge expectations regarding the whole economy with its own sector
  - The sum of market-share could not bt greater than one

* Housing AB model

** General topics

- Check whether a finite housing demand is not incompatible with a infinite labour supply
- Explicitly present how house prices affects the whole economy

** Model design


- Construction sector aggregate
- Finite demand for housing is not compatible with infinity households
- Try different interest rates

** Hypothesis

- How do households choose among houses and financial assets?
- How do households decide where and when to move out?
  - Rent above some threshould?
- Do rich households buy houses with High Powered Cash?
- Does the houses own rate of interest is a macro or microeconomic result?

** Possible Topics


- Allow govern expenditure grow at a different rate and induce financial instability endogenously
  - Allow more scenarios (not only related to households)
- Credit cycle is not endogenous if asset bubbles are exogenous
- Discuss residential investment inclusion in other ABM

* Spatial housing AB model

** Model design

- Is a fixed grid size incompatible with speculation as a results of speculation with land?
