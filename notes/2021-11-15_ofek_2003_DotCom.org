| *Background*                                  | There was nothing unusual with internet sector (based on price characteristic) that could explain the stock value increase. Prior to the [[id:d6f6bc83-b082-492a-8776-689614359fb6][Asset bubble]] burst, large number of lookup aggrement expired, adding new investors to the market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| *Supporting Ideas*                            | [[id:4dd9747a-0849-49bc-99dc-f226c5605270][Short sales constraints]] models in which those restrictions rule the pessimistic agent out. Thus, only optimistic agents persists (the pessimistic investors were overrun). There was a significant number of shares that were not allowed to trade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| *Purpose*                                     | To evaluate whether the dot-com crisis is a result of heterogenous expectations and short-sale restrictions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| *Design/methodology/approach*                 | _Dataset:_ 400 Internet-related firms (01/1998-02/2000). *Method:* Descriptive statistics. The authors test the existance of investors heterogeneity comparing the first day of trading with the [[id:ec072781-8bb4-4bef-b21f-69622337cf69][Quiet Period End]]. The authors also evaluate six-months post-lookup in order to check the effect of pessimistic investors sell out their positions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| *Results*                                     | Present evidences in which during the [[id:bb809699-e4e4-4ee1-bc36-671d6a8a9d76][Mania]] that lead to the [[id:8d3c092d-8546-4dc0-8a04-55d3d8a09191][Dot Com crisis]], trade volume increased (together with decrease in block trading levels) and stock price increase. The impact of lookup expiration is related to *insider selling*. This insider selling is concentrated close to the lookup experation date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| *(Interesting) Findings*                      | Most investors were retail rather than institutional ones, so more demand-driven from retail investors. Both first trade day and the Quiet Period End were associated with volume and price increase. Block trades are, usually, between two institutions. Large differences between returns conditional on levels of block trading. Thus, there are evidence for [[id:a3b9da87-5fcc-4e91-a3e7-65531ab57ad6][Heterogeneous expectations]]. A lookup end period generates: (a) Permanent shift in the amount of available share; (b) Shift in the class of investors; (c) If there is heterogeneity accross investors and short sale restrictions, it is expected a drop in the stock price. |
| *Research limitations/implications (Critics)* | Considering the [[id:e20ae018-ac3b-4b4e-8108-29f84b898745][Innovation bubble ABM]] model, this paper only provides an inspiration for the [[id:d1e7f9d2-e144-4f49-931e-5c0f3cd6d5c8][Autonomous Investment Bubble]]. This is the case because capital goods price does not necessarily goes up during this kind of bubble.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| *Uncategorized stuff*                         | Lookup aggrement is the most commom form of sale constraint. The authors recognize the possibility of other financial assets to bet against the Internet bubble and relax the short-sale constraint. At odds with other sectors, there is a gradual drop after the lookup period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

** Abstract

#+BEGIN_ABSTRACT
This paper explores a model based on agents with heterogenous beliefs facing short sales restrictions, and its explanation for the rise, persistence, and eventual fall of Internet stock prices. First, we document substantial short sale restrictions for Internet stocks. Second, using data on Internet holdings and block trades, we show a link between heterogeneity and price e¡ects for Internet stocks.Third, arguing that lockup expirations are a loosening of the short sale constraint, we document average, long-run excess returns as low as À 33 percent for Internet stocks postlockup.We link the Internet bubble burst to the unprecedented level of lockup expirations and insider selling.

* Specific notes


- The authors also use the concept of [[id:96240415-033d-47e3-ad23-b28f5dd83fa7][Rebate rate]] and indicates the difficulty to short
- The authors argues that although internet sector was more short relative to the "Old Economy", it does not mean that it reached the limit to short more
  - However, the evidence is that more internet-related sector reached the limit of short-position
