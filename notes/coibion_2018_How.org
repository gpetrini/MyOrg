Data was collected using survey forms from the managers. The authors measure inattention as the errors of firms beliefs and the actual values. In other set of experiments, the authors treated a group with additional information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| *Results*                                     | Firms do not pay so much attention to general [[id:560fac35-1ffa-4fbd-ad75-49aafc4bbd5f][Inflation]]  as they do to GDP or to the sectoral inflation (their own consumption behavior). Divergences regarding inflation forecast and backcast are a result of inattention to recent conditions. Firms with more competitors or near to set a new price level track new information more recurrently. Other results is that firms seems to validate models of [[id:05557c68-06ae-4505-ae5f-0096879841a3][Bayesian learning]]. Also, firms update their forecast when there are negative economic news compared with positive ones. The authors did not find any difference between the treatment group (which received additional information) and the control group. This results is the same for a long-run expectation (effect of information had dissipated). The main effect of expectations on inflation seems to be on *desired quantities of inputs* into the production. One major results is that most of firms care about *GDP* (sometimes employment level) than inflation (even those firms that categorize it as the least important variable still track it). |
| *(Interesting) Findings*                      | The authors also find some non-ergotic conclusions in which different beliefs about the past will affect the beliefs about the future. Besides the errors dispersion is not unique to inflation, the *asymmetry* is. Managers personal characteristics play little role on inflation error size. Firms facing higher uncertanty level wait for the others until decide whether to change price or not; so there is some kind of interaction (leaving room for [[id:95d640e3-9fbc-4861-b78b-ec28d55d571b][Heterogeinity]])                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

** Abstract

#+BEGIN_ABSTRACT
We survey New Zealand firms and document novel facts about their macroeconomic beliefs. There is widespread dispersion in beliefs about past and future macroeconomic conditions, especially inflation. This dispersion in beliefs is consistent with firms' incentives to collect and process information. Using experimental methods, we find that firms update their beliefs in a Bayesian manner when presented with new information about the economy and that changes in their beliefs affect their decisions. Inflation is not generally perceived as being important to business decisions so firms devote few resources to collecting and processing information about inflation.
