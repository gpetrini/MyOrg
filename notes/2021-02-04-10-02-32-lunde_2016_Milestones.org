** Introduction
Some scholars blame the housing finance dysfunctionality as one of the main causes of the low recovery after the GFC.
However, housing finance was seen as a good example of deregulation and privatization[fn::Due to lower interest rates, higher owner-occupation, etc.].
As a general movement, there is a over-exposed risk in mortgage market.
This pattern occurs even in heavily-regulated mortgage markets.
Despite this regularity, there are still different *regulatory frameworks*, but the similarities are growing even faster.

The authors state the 1989-2014 period is unique in which mortgage and house prices moved in parallel.

** Defining housing finance
In this section, the authors argue the "housing finance" definition is more broad than usual.
*Conventional definition:* operation of mortgage markets in the form of housing loans or mortgage loans that enable consumers – owner‐occupiers and sometimes landlords –- to -­ borrow against the value of their housing asset.
They state:
  #+begin_quote
However, housing finance is actually a much broader concept, including financing through the owners’ own resources (i.e. their equity) and – where
relevant – financing by subsidies.
The initial equity (down payment) is often seen as ensuring that the purchaser has a stake in the value of the property, thus reducing the risks faced by the mortgagee. Over time as the mortgage is paid down, as is a common family life‐cycle pattern and, especially if house prices rise, the owners’ equity increases and becomes the predominant source of housing finance for the property.
  #+end_quote

Next, the author point out that housing system were historically dominated by government provisions, subsidy and source of borrowing.
More recently, government involvement has fallen (both production and provision) and been replaced by private source of finance.
Other relevant change is the permission of equity withdraw at the time of raising a new mortgage and its uses not related to purchasing housing assets.
Additionally, there is finance provision to developer (?) and this is related to *bank solvency* at the time of the GFC.

** Countries

The countries in the sample indicates the globalization dimension of the housing deregularization.
They can be clusterised as follows:
- *Anglo-Saxon (most market-oriented):* United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia
- *Welfare countries:* Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden; in a minor degree Netherlands, France and Belgium
- *Central European corporatist system:* Germany and Austria
- *Ex-communist countries:* Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Russia and Slovenia
- *Southern European Countries:* Portugal, Spain and Turkey

| *Dissertation:* This classification could be used as an expectactional path groups in both QCA and tsPanel. |

** Trends in mortgage systems

The authors refer to textcite:green_2010_Housing for an analysis of changes in the USA mortgage market.
As a result of incentives, deregulation, liberalization, housing finance system become more efficient and housing access has increased.
Some of this changes are:
- Easier entry into owner occupation
- Interest rates decrease
- Increase of lifetime affordability
- Removing government (!)
- Increasing competition
The authors also highlight that this changes occurred during a period of persistent interest rate decreases.
Additionally, this period can be characterized as lower growth rates and higher house prices.

** Mortgage debt and price increases - enabling each other?
*** The expansion in mortgage debt
They start this section pointing out textcite:jorda_2016_Great discoveries: the great mortgaging.
Next, they highlight some results that shows the higher household debt is, the longer and deeper the recession is.
cite:woodHousePricesPrivate2020 found similar results as well.

Based on hypostat database, they present how mortgage debt and house prices moved together during the analyzed period.
Netherlands is the country with higher mortgage to GDP ratio while Germany and Austria have the lowest one.
The former is characterized by high LTV ratios; unconstrained tax reliefs for mortgages interests and a shift from public to private financing (social housing in particular).
Further diversion (after GFC) of this ratio seens to be related more to GDP movements than to debt levels.
One of the main changes is the increase of private commercial and mortgaging banking sector:

#+begin_quote
They slowly started to put in place the legal and institutional arrangements necessary for the introduction of mortgage financing and once in place, usually experienced rapid growth rates in outstanding mortgage debt – although from very low levels.
#+end_quote
Additionally, they argue that the mortgage interest rate decrease reduce the requirement downpayments, including lower income households in the market.
At one hand, the house price increase has also increase the collateral against which to borrow.
At the other, this increase worsened housing affordability, so households needed to borrow more and excluded lower income ones.

| *Dissertation:* Since house prices increased, it is not reasonable to lower income households were the ones who speculated with houses. |

*** Trends in house prices
The author's explained this rapid house price increase with growing income --- which is at odds with higher income concentration ---, easier access to credit and *mainly* the relationship between house price rises and capacity to borrow.
*** Bringing the two together
They analyze some series in which highlights the following:
- Countries with higher mortgage debt are those with higher house price inflation
- Germany runs in the opposite direction: house price decrease and increase after the GFC
- Belgium present a stability in house price, different from other countries

| *Dissertation:* Is reasonable to relate the different patter *after* the GFC with the diversity in the institutional arrangements? Thus the increasing similarity at odds with this proposal? |

** Mortgage systems

*** The overall picture
- High participation of public sector before and decreasing since the deregulation period
- Restricted Loans are more rare while *remortgaging* and *equity withdraw* are widely accepted
- More loans with longer terms and new instruments
- Some of these changes have been reversed after the GFC


#+begin_note
Some Eastern European countries did not have a housing financing system prior to 1989.
Thus, in a case-comparative paradigm, it may be needed start after 1989.
It will depends on how relevant those Eastern European countries are for the study.
#+end_note

*** The decline in equity financing
As a consequence of lower relevance of equity financing, households has been more leveraged and higher risks for both borrower and lenders.
Austria, Germany and Hungary have some residuals of previous "funding model" in which some households have access to lower interest rates as long as they have saved for a period before (/Bausparkasel/).
Other common-ground is the absence of downpayments requirements.

#+begin_note
The authors state that the removal of downpayment requeriments are a result of banking competition and deregularization, booming the housing buble.
#+end_note
Equity withdraws have become more common while loan terms have been lengthened.
Additionally, interest-only mortgages have become even more available.
Finally, some of this changes have been reversed after the GFC, mainly on equity withdraw and interest-only mortgages.

** Funding the supply of mortgages

Campbell (2012, apud, p. 17-19) proposes the following classification of mortgage systems:
- deposit‐financed mortgage systems ::  bank/originator holds the loans on the balance sheet and uses deposits as the funding source
- Securitised mortgage system :: where mortgages are packaged into pools and where repackaging can be used to form different bond types, to be sold to investors
- Coverd bonds :: claims on the originator that are collateralised by pools of mortgages but where the underlying mortgages remain on the books of the originators

In 1989, deposit and covered bonds were, respectively, the first and second most common funding method.
After 25 year, only a few countries uses depositys only method as a funding method.
#+begin_tip
There were not a common "European funding method" in 1989
#+end_tip
#+begin_note
Compare these movements with a transtion plot
#+end_note
Other relevant change is the present of covered bond in 18 countries while 26 out 28 EU countries have legislation about it.
Additionally, *mortgage backed securities* were increased used from mid-1990 and is relevant for UK, Australia and Ireland.

#+begin_note
The typical movement is: housing funding methods were typically public (or subsidized) and became more and more based on market priced deposits; capital markets fundings (/e.g./ mortgage backed and covered bonds).
#+end_note
** Mortgage characteristics

The authors states that the mortgage differences have decreased as a result of competition and regulation.

*** Credit assessment
Besides being legally required in only 4 countries, it was a usual business practice in all sample.

*** Property valuation and registration
It was a common practice to use property value as a collateral, but was legally based only in 5 of them.
In some countries, it would even affect the interest rate charged.
In some cases (Finland, France and Germany), construction costs or even transaction was used instead of valuation.
Now, all countries requires a *public registration*.

*** Lending restrictions on access to a mortgage or housing loan
When public sector had a prominent role in determining housing funding, budgets limits were the only way to restrict loan for a house purchase.
Theses restriction are a results of usual business practices in which the LTV rule (normally 80%) was the most commonly used.
In 2014, all countries used LTV rules.
Downpayments requirements are another type of restriction for first-time buyer, buy its relevance is decreasing.
DTI rules are also in use, but not legally required except for Hungary and Poland.
#+BEGIN_tip
Besides the absence of downpayments requirements, LTV caps may act like an indirect downpayment.
Other relevant topic for the QCA model is the difference between standard business practice and legislation rules.
#+END_tip

*** Terms, currency employed and access to equity withdrawal
The maximum term were not a legally requirement[fn::Today, the maximum term is only legally based in two countries.].
In 1989, those caps were considerable diverse; while countries with no market mortgage system, the terms was generally short.
Additionally, only Australia, Germany and Slovenia allowed to raise mortgages denominated in other currency (for owner-occupied only).
However, this allowance increased until the GFC and now started to be reversed and even prohibited.

Access to equity withdraw (by raising or extending a mortage) was highly restricted.
Portugal and Spain was two exceptions, but besides it possibility, it was not commonly used due to cultural traditions.
During theses 25 years, the equity withdraws had became more general, beeing possible in 14 countries in the sample.

*** Credit risk and guarantees
The respondents to the questionnaire noted that the lender generally carries the credit risk associated with a loan contract.
The authors also points out that little has changed between 1989 and 2014.
Additionally (p.29):

*** How mortgage interest rates are determined

One of the main change is the increase of number of loan types available.
The length of when an interest rate can remain fixed still varies.
In 2014, fixed interest rate period has been shortened and have the capability to determine the interest rate *individually* on loan in 7 countries.
Generally, the interest rate for a single loan is equal to a reference index plus a margin (as determined by individual lender).
It is not usual to the type of interest rate is influenced by any legal requirement.

*** Foreclosures
The use of foreclosure depends on the costs and efficiency of its mechanisms.
For 1989, few respondants had the necessary information.
In 2014, the average duration was 2-3 years.
In all countries in the sample, the borrower is the responsable for the uncovered debt after the foreclosure.
#+begin_note
Even in 1989 most Eastern European countries had some private ownership and some sort of foreclosure system.
