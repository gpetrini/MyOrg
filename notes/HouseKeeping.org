* Capturing literature notes

I manage my bibliography with org-ref, ivy-bibtex, and org-roam-bibtex.
I maintain a file per resource (book/article/paper/talk).
All notes are in the same directory for simplicity.
My references are manage by Zotero and are updated whenever I add a new entry.

** Template

Each bibliographic note is generated with 3 parts:
- Backlinks :: Used to reference other notes (using org-roam)
- FISH-5SS :: It is a quick [[https://posgraduando.com/fish-qtcr-5ss-leitura-artigos/][noting procedure]] in which I create a summary table (FISH) with one-sentence overview (5SS)
- Specific comments :: Some topics that are too specific to be captured by FISH-5SS method
- Paper highlights :: PDF highlights and comments extracted using Zotero's PDF.js utility

** Naming files

Since I use org-roam capture, naming files are easy.
By default, I use the following pattern =%Y-%M-%d_bibtex_entry.org=.


* Knowledge base

- All notes must be under =notes= folder
  + This allows to use org-roam link facilities
- Use org-roam default template

* Bibliographical notes

- All notes must be under =notes= folder
  + This allows to use org-roam link facilities
- Write note using org-roam capture template
- Review if it is adequate for sharing
- Include link path in =./index.org= using the following pattern:
  + =Authors (Year) - Title [iwth link] (note link)=

* Reading list


** Html shortcuts :noexport:

Keyboard shortcuts to save time and boost your productivity:

| Shortcut | What it does                      |
|----------+-----------------------------------|
| =?= or =h=   | Access the *dashboard*              |
| =n=        | Move to the *next* main heading     |
| =p=        | Move to the *previous* main heading |
| =b=        | Scroll up                         |
| =<=        | Scroll to top                     |
| =>=        | Scroll to bottom                  |
| =-=        | Collapse all                      |
| =+=        | Expand all                        |
| =r=        | Go to next task in list           |
| =R=        | Go to previous task in list       |
| =q=        | Stop reviewing the list of tasks  |
| =g=        | Reload the page                   |

** Naming
- url :: Follow org-clipling capture template.
- non-url :: Authors (Year) - Title
** Categories instructions


- Inbox :: Add a tag related to a prior classification topic (/e.g./ Dissertation chapter, paper, method, etc)
- Dissertation :: Add a tag related to a chapter. Entries are organized in themes and not in chapters
  + Why? :: Same entry can be used for more than one purpose
  + How? :: Each subheading is a *phantom file* so it only makes reference for the topic
  + Next? :: After determine the topic, create an org-roam-file entry
- Journal frontier overview :: Add a tag with journal abbreviation and keywords in other tags
- Courses :: Create subheadings regarding course topic
- Papers :: Add a tag related to the section planed to include the reading
- Orientation :: Decision entry regards how student should read
- Lectures :: Readings regarding lecture planning and to answer questions. Each entry must have a tag whether is a =fundamental=, =critique=, =empirical counterfactual= and =overview=

** Steps

*Organization:*
1. Review reading inbox
2. Refile
3. Set custom ID using org-roam utilities
4. Define reading sequence and sort
5. Run archive
6. Read

*After read:*
1. Update status
2. Compile html file
3. Commit

* Inbox and projects


*Note:* This is adapted from [[https://www.alexeyshmalko.com/how-i-note/][Alexey's Brain dump]].

Once a day I process my inbox: literature notes from org-roam, fleeting notes, tasks, and articles from org file.

During the daily review, I retype fleeting notes from my notebook into digital files. (There are little notes per day, so retyping doesnâ€™t bother me.) I maintain a file per resource (book/article/paper/talk).

Articles to read go into my reading inbox.
Tasks and emails are refiled into Tasks inbox.

- Pile all interesting articles to read below
- Use capture template for online articles
- Use org-capture facility to note unprocessed tasks
- Every day process TODOs and projects files
- Refile inbox items to =projects= file

** Writing inbox


- If I want to write about something, add a note bellow
- Tag a project related to it
- Review the writing inbox before start writing about the respective topic


* Teaching and Lectures


- Notes links must be under a year heading
- Provide syllabus when available
- Non-org file must be under respective folder
  + All files must be text-based
- Figures, tables, output and presentations must be under corresponding folder:
