| *Purpose*                                     | Investigate the differences and similarity for the Sweden and UK housing market.                                                                        |
| *Originality/value (Contribution)*            | Evaluates if it would be possible to elaborate an single theory for housing.                                                                            |

| *Design/methodology/approach*                 | ECM model based on a Stock-flow framework in which the interaction between demand and supply of structure determines the asset price.                   |
| *Sample*                                      | UK and Sweden: 1970-1998                                                                                                                                |
| *Results*                                     | For Sweden, income Granger Causes house prices while UK also presents and feedback relation.                                                            |

| *Uncategorized stuff*                         | House prices trends are quite different between countries. The authors point out a ressurgence of Tobin'Q theory applied to explain housing investment. |

* Theoretical considerations
The augmented Tobin model of housing investment incorporating the interest rate can be written as:

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
q = \frac{PH}{PB}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
\frac{IH}{H} = h (q(+), r(-))
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
H^{S} = IH + (1-\delta)H_{t-1}
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
- $PH$ Market price
- $PB$ Construction price
- $r$ real interest rate (?)
- $\delta$ depreciation

In long-equilibrium, the value of Tobin’s q converges to 1

| Granger causality test            | UK                               | Sweden                          |

| House prices and income           | Both                             | Income to house prices          |
| House prices and financial wealth | Financial wealth to house prices | Prices to Financial Wealth      |
| House prices and household debt   | Debt to house prices             | House prices to debt            |
| House prices and interest rate    | Interest rate to house prices    | Interest rate to house prices   |
| Tobin's Q and housing investment  | Tobin's Q to housing investment  | Tobin's Q to housing investment |
|-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+---------------------------------|

Our test results indicate that for both Sweden and the UK, Tobin’s q Granger causes housing investment because the construction industry bases its investment decisions on profitability as reflected by the q index.
