  abstract = {We use the 2018 and 2019 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) datasets to measure racial bias in residential loan approval across the 20 largest mortgage granting institutions in the U.S. These data sets re\textdaggerdbl ect the changes in reporting requirements enacted in 2015, and include important variables which were missing from previous HMDA public samples. We \ldots nd large variation in measured discrimination across institutions, ranging 2.4pp - 15.5pp for Black applicants in 2018 (1.9pp - 13.1pp in 2019), and 0.4pp - 10pp for Hispanic applicants in 2018 (0.2pp - 8.1pp in 2019). The nation-wide estimates fall close to the middle of these ranges, and therefore mask the wide variation across institutions. We argue that comparison across major institutions reduces the impact of omitted-variable bias, which cast doubt on previous \ldots ndings of "discrimination" based on HMDA public data. For such cross-institutions gaps to be driven by omitted variables, would require unusual sorting of minority applicants across institutions. Our \ldots ndings of discrimination are more compelling due to (i) newly available variables, (ii) comparison across institutions, and (iii) the use of Oaxaca-Blinder-Ferlie decomposition, which reduces the bias due to omission of variables correlated with race. We advocate for internal and external fair-lending reviews of institutions, starting with the ones at the top of our list in terms of discrimination.},

  shorttitle = {Housing {{Amid Covid}}-19},
  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted construction, made it difficult for many households to pay for shelter, and seriously hurt the housing sector. Governments have responded with a wide array of measures to protect tenants and mortgage-holders, as well as support builders and lenders. This note mobilises web-search data to shed new light on the impact of the crisis on the construction sector. It then takes stock of measures taken by governments and argues that some of the relief could, if not duly phased out as planned, create unintended inefficiencies and notably make housing supply less responsive to changes in demand and the evolving needs of society. The note concludes by building on recent empirical findings that stress the importance of gradually transitioning from immediate rescue measures to policy settings that can support the recovery and the development of efficient, inclusive and sustainable housing markets.},
