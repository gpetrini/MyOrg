* Defining the research question <2025-07-10 qui>

- Code is ready and tested for a simple model
  - Industry and Island model is ready
- First paper to calibrate the model and not adjust the values using [[denote:20240314T120430][Data Assimilation]]
- When there are interdependent parameter, the might have some problems in which the value goes to the right direction, but the parameter goes to the wrong direction
  - It impose that it is better to select the parameters manually rather than callibrate all of them
  - Any equation that have more than one parameter, this problem might happen
  - One suggestion, is to focus on the relevant parameters which sensitivity analisys (from the papers)
- Focus on the centralized labor-market (finance or energy) and variable number of firms
  - Present the energy model as a new model
  - Note: Finance is just for teaching, so it will be better to use the K+S-energy
  - Likely calibrate with USA data using Sidneys work
  - The energy sector and the climate box is different from the DSK model, but the way firms react to energy is the same as DSK
    - It has a competition among the energy sector, not a centralized one
    - The technical coefficient between E-, and C-firms are different
    - The energy sector has circulatiry since it need capital goods and K-firms need energy
- Add policy experiments:
  - Public R&D: Based on a new frontier exogenous to the firms (easy to implement)
  - Profit share among industries: differencial taxes can impact the share among firms (just a scenario analysis)
  - Create a reservation bucket
- Measure the similarity before and after turning on DA and apply the similarity protocol on that
