  abstract = {This article evaluates the ability of the yield spread to forecast real economic activity in 11 industrial countries. The first section of this article defines the yield spread and explains why the spread may be a useful predictor of real economic activity. The second section describes the data and criteria used to evaluate the predictive power of the yield spread. The third section examines whether yield spreads have reliably forecast real economic activity in the 11 countries, using several measures of real economic activity and alternative forecast horizons. The empirical results indicate the yield spread is a statistically and economically significant predictor of real economic activity in several industrial countries besides the United States. In addition, the yield spread forecasting model generally outperforms two alternative forecasting models in predicting future real GDP growth.},

We estimate the impact of P HE on U.S. consumer sentiment after controlling for several observable macroeconomic and political variables. We conclude that the direct measure of P HE is the single most important variable, explaining between 20\% and 30\% of the consumer sentiment variance at different horizons. The widely employed Economic Policy Uncertainty (EP U ) measure is weakly correlated with P HE and explains at most 10\% of consumer sentiment variance. Economic policy uncertainty is decidedly politically, and, at least in the U.S., also Presidential.},

  abstract = {This paper seeks to address the policy issue of the usefulness of \textregistered nancial spreads as indicators of future in\textasciimacron ation and output growth in the countries of the European Union, placing a particular focus on out-ofsample forecasting performance. Such analysis is of considerable relevance to monetary authorities, given the breakdown of the money/income relation in a number of countries and following increased emphasis of domestic monetary policy on control of in\textasciimacron ation following the broadening of the ERM bands. The results con\textregistered rm that for some countries, \textregistered nancial spread variables do contain some information about future output growth and in\textasciimacron ation, with the yield curve and the reverse yield gap performing best. However, the relatively poor out-of-sample forecasting performance and/or parameter instability suggests that the need for caution in using spread variables for forecasting in EU countries. Only a small number of spreads contain information, and improve forecasting in a manner which is stable over time. \# 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Overall, consumer confidence falls and long interest rates rise upon the announcement of a fiscal consolidation. These effects are stronger for revenue-based announcements than for spending-based announcements. Counterfactual experiments show that the combined effect of the responses of consumer confidence and interest rates amplifies the negative effect on the real economy of announcements of revenue-based austerity measures.},

  abstract = {The recent financial crisis shows that financial markets can impact the real economy. We investigate whether access to finance typically time-varies and, if so, what are the real effects. Consistent with time-varying external finance costs, both investment and employment are less sensitive to Tobin's q and more sensitive to cash flow during recessions and low investor sentiment periods. Share issuance plays a bigger role than debt issuance in causing these effects. Alternative tests that do not rely on q and cash flow sensitivities suggest that recessions and low sentiment increase external finance costs, thereby limiting investment and employment.},
