  abstract = {Our model is based on a Kaleckian basis, which is enriched by three simple, intuitive hypotheses. Firstly, an unemployment benefits system organizes the distribution of the wage bill between employed and unemployed workers, the latter receiving an amount of money corresponding to the subsistence level. Secondly, only individuals with an income above the subsistence level build savings. The combination of these two hypotheses gives rise to an autonomous consumption expenditure whose rate of growth is given by the demographic rate of growth. As a consequence, the rate of capital accumulation spontaneously converges towards the demographic rate of growth (supermultiplier effect), a dynamics that gives a solution to one of the two Harrodian instability problems. The third hypothesis corresponds to the entrepreneurs' attempts to adjust investment in order to restore the normal rate of capacity utilization. Whereas such assumption usually generates knife-edge instability, we show here that this instability can be eliminated by the stabilizing properties of the supermultiplier. Moreover, the attempts to adjust investment enable to restore the normal rate of capacity utilization. In summary, the model offers a simple, simultaneous solution to the two Harrodian instability problems.},

The debate focuses on the inclusion of profit margin in the investment function as a way to characterize the effective demand regime in the neoliberal era as a profit-led growth regime. Our argument is that this inclusion is not able to evaluate properly the countries' economic growth in terms of the consistency between its effective demand regimes and income distribution.},

It designs a strategy on the basis of the idea of the existence of three demandled ``growth fronts,'' or three ``engines of investment'': mass consumption, natural resources and infrastructure. The article stresses the relevance of putting into action two ``turbo-chargers'' of these three engines of investment; namely technological innovation and the recuperation of traditional productive chains. Finally, the author argues that this formula can be a viable long term pattern of economic growth, analogous to that which occurred in the past as a result of industrialization.},

Beyond the display of the evolution of such models, the paper intends to demonstrate that the original kaldorian models have served as a solid foundation over which new formulations have been built, continually demonstrating the relevance of the author's ideas. The model's extensions, other than allowing for the incorporation of an increasing number of economic characteristics originally proposed by Kaldor, also have considerably increased the analytical scope of the field by establishing theoretical links with other schools of thought. A neo-schumpeterian view is possible via the introduction of the impacts of technological gaps and innovation into the models. In its turn, a structuralist perspective is obtained by decomposing trade elasticities. Finally, from kaleckian growth models, the importance of a multi-sectoral analysis and of distinct distributive regimes over economic growth is brought to the models.},

  abstract = {The Great Financial Crisis of 2007-09 confirmed the vital importance of advancing our understanding of macrofinancial linkages, the two-way interactions between the real economy and the financial sector. The crisis was a bitter reminder of how sharp fluctuations in asset prices, credit and capital flows can have dramatic impact on the financial positions of households, corporations and sovereign nations. As fluctuations were amplified, the global financial system was brought to the brink of collapse and the deepest contraction in world output in more than half a century followed. Moreover, unprecedented challenges for fiscal, monetary and financial regulatory policies resulted. The crisis revived an old debate in the economics profession about the importance of macrofinancial linkages. Some argue that the crisis was a painful reminder of our limited knowledge of these linkages. Others claim that the profession had already made substantial progress in understanding them but that there was too much emphasis on narrow approaches and modelling choices. Yet, most also recognise that the absence of a unifying framework to study these two-way interactions has limited the practical applications of existing knowledge and impeded the formulation of policies. With these observations in mind, this paper presents a systematic review of the rapidly expanding literature on macrofinancial linkages. It first surveys the literature on the linkages between asset prices and macroeconomic outcomes. It then reviews the literature on the macroeconomic implications of financial imperfections. It also examines the global dimensions of macrofinancial linkages and documents the main stylized facts about the linkages between the real economy and the financial sector. The topic of macrofinancial linkages promises to remain an exciting area of research, given the many open questions and significant policy interest. The paper concludes with a discussion of possible directions for future research, stressing the need for richer theoretical models, more robust empirical work and better quality data so as to advance knowledge and help guide policymakers going forward},

Are such processes able to account for the statistical regularities which industrial structures and dynamics display? In this work we address this question by means of a simple multi-firm model formalizing the mechanisms of learning and selection. As such, despite its simplicity, the model is able to robustly reproduce an ensemble of empirical stylized facts, including ample heterogeneity in productivity distributions, persistent market turbulence, and fat-tailed distribution of growth rates.},

Platforms sell broadband Internet access services to residential consumers and may set fees to content and application providers on the Internet. When access is monopolized, cross-group externalities (network effects) can give a rationale for network neutrality regulation (requiring zero fees to content providers): there exist parameter ranges for which network neutrality regulation increases the total surplus compared to the fully private optimum at which the monopoly platform imposes positive fees on content providers. However, for other parameter values, network neutrality regulation can decrease total surplus. Extending the model to a duopoly of residential broadband ISPs, we again find parameter values such that network neutrality regulation increases total surplus suggesting that network neutrality regulation could be warranted even when some competition is present. \'O 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Firms produce a homogeneous good employing technologies located in an open-ended technological space and are allowed to either imitate existing similar practices or to locally explore the technological space to find new, more productive, techniques. We first identify sufficient conditions for the emergence of empirically plausible GDP time-series characterized by self-sustained growth. Then, we study the trade-off between individual rationality and collective outcomes by providing an example in which more rational agents systematically perform worse than less rational ones.},

In economics the industrial dynamics approach makes use of simulation techniques to understand the complexity of the industrial process of continuous change. Among these models, a new branch of studies known as ``History-friendly'' models aims at establishing a close link between formal theory, developing stand-alone theoretical simulation models, and empirical evidence. In this paper, we study ``History-friendly'' analyses and counterfactuals. Some examples of ``History-friendly'' models are widely examined. Finally, the paper makes a critical contribution to ``History-friendly'' methodology and defines the role of ``History-friendly'' models in the debate on the empirical validation of simulations.},

  abstract = {The use of simulation modelling techniques by neo-Schumpeterian economists dates back to Nelson and Winter's 1982 book ``An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change'', and has rapidly expanded ever since. This paper considers the way in which successive generations of models have extended the boundaries of research (both with respect to the range of phenomena considered and the different dimensions of innovation that are considered), and while simultaneously introducing novel modelling techniques. At the same time, the paper will highlight the distinct set of features that have emerged in these neo-Schumpeterian models, and which set them apart from the models developed by other schools. In particular, they share a distinct view about the type of world in which real economic agents operate, and a invariably contain a generic set of algorithms. In addition to reviewing past models, the paper considers a number of pressing issues that remain unresolved and which modellers will need to address in future. Notable amongst these are the methodological relationship between empirical studies and simulation (e.g. `history friendly modelling'), the development of common standards for sensitivity analysis, and the need to further extend the boundaries of research in order to consider important aspects of innovation and technical change.},

  abstract = {In 1961, Nicholas Kaldor used his list of six "stylized" facts both to summarize the patterns that economists had discovered in national income accounts and to shape the growth models that they were developing to explain them. Redoing this exercise today, nearly fifty years later, shows how much progress we have made. In contrast to Kaldor's facts, which revolved around a single state variable, physical capital, our six updated facts force consideration of four far more interesting variables: ideas, institutions, population, and human capital. Dynamic models have uncovered subtle interactions between these variables and generated important insights about such big questions as: Why has growth accelerated? Why are there gains from trade?},

Among the schools of thought represented are transaction-cost economics: evolutionary theories: modern 'Austrian' economies: law and economics: reliability theory: and the game-theory approach to the economics of social institutions. The essays are united not by a single topic but by a coherent set of themes - themes best described under the heading of the New Institutional Economics. These include an interest in economic processes as well as in states of equilibrium: a sensitivity to the limits and contours of human rationality: and an emphasis on the various sorts of social institutions that aid and inform economic action. But the essays are not solely methodological or critical. They also include substantive essays that illustrate the New Institutional Economics in practice.},

In the last years, several contributions at the empirical, appreciative, econometric and modelling levels have greatly advanced our understanding of innovation, industrial dynamics and the evolution of industries. This paper reviews these contributions. A discussion follows on four key challenges that are required for a better understanding of the relationship between innovation and the evolution of industries: the analyses of demand, knowledge, networks and coevolution.},

  author = {Nalin, Lorenzo and Yajima, Giuliano Toshiro},
  pages = {35},
  abstract = {The literature on development economics in the last decade has rediscovered the role of the exchange rate policy as an important instrument to foster growth. In particular, the works of Rodrik (2008), and Freund and Pierola (2008: 2012) discussed both theoretically and empirically the channels through which an undervalued real exchange rate could benefit the economy. Nonetheless, the debate generated by these seminal works has proven that there is no consensus neither on this positive effect nor on the ways trough which an undervaluation could prove itself beneficial \textendash{} not mentioning the estimation techniques. Moreover, most of the contributions that adopted the theoretical framework of Rodrik seem to disregard the profound transformations that have suffered developing economies in the last thirty years, as they accomplished a greater integration in financial markets, somehow at the detriment of the local productive structure (UNCTAD, 2018). This new evidence is likely to have undermined even more some of the potential channels through which this policy was supposed to operate. Our contribution aims at rethink the latter by constructing an analytical macro model based on Dvoskin, Feldman and Ianni (2018). We will consider, in particular, the financial cost of imported capital goods and the uncertainty related to currency volatility.},

  abstract = {The paper offers an interpretation of the General Theory based on two main assumptions: (i) that its core is heterodox (meaning far from Neoclassical references) and (ii) that, while not working out a dynamic model, it is neither static nor based on the notion of equilibrium in the usual sense, i.e. as an attractor. It amounts rather to a foreword to a dynamic theory, given its emphasis on (future) time and expectations. The exposition is centered on the division between short and long run (period) with corresponding particularities and distinctions. In the first case, a more general concept of the principle of effective demand is proposed, from which the relation investment/savings, supply and demand functions at the Micro level \textendash{} where basic variables are determined -, the ``point of effective demand'' and corresponding aggregative versions are interpreted. In the second case, investment decisions are examined on the light of chap. 17, concerning investment in capital assets, i.e. individual demand for assets. The central concept of uncertainty is introduced here, giving place to money as an asset as well as to liquidity preference and the rate of interest theories. Long term expectations under uncertainty give rise to other two key concepts \textendash{} the state of confidence and the convention. As a result, his peculiar and crucial notion of instability of investment follows, as well as its extension to the capitalist economy as a whole.},

Firms cite ample cash holdings as the most frequent reason to explain their lack of sensitivity. This result is consistent with dynamic models of corporate behavior in which firms build cash buffers in anticipation of potential changes in external financing conditions. In the cross section, we find that the investment plans tend to be the least sensitive to interest rate changes at firms that do not expect to borrow over the coming year and firms facing less-binding financing constraints.},

The evolutionaryeconomics simulation models are exemplified by the Nelson\textendash Winter family of models of Schumpeterian competition in an industry (or an economy). To abbreviate we call such models NelWin models. The new system for the programming and simulation of such models is called the Laboratory for Simulation Development\textemdash abbreviated as Lsd.},

  abstract = {Taking into account the various interpretations can be presented to net neutrality this article support the backward-looking net neutrality lite". It's a bland and conservative network neutrality approach, by which the user should not be hindered by no transparent and arbitrary practices, on behalf the network providers (ISPs). Some countries starting to regulate the net neutrality law like Brazil presents a window of opportunity to introduce not only the backward-looking net neutrality lite but also some legal mechanisms in order to manage the net neutrality in an efficient way. The article also presents a snap of the net neutrality debate in the United States and in Brazil in order to provide insights for regulation of the Brazilian ``Civil Rights Framework for the Internet'' Law \# 12.965/14.},
