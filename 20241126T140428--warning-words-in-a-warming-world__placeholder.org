* Purpose, Relevance, and Contribution

- Novel dataset of central bank speeches (1986-2023)
  - Most contributions uses BIS
  - Other institutions does not have all speeches translated to English
  - Contribution: complements the database with webscrapper from central bank websites
- Analysis on climate-related communication
- Structural topic model with two narratives:
  - Green finance
  - Climate-related financial risks
- Portfolio analysis (US) and firm-specific [[denote:20241126T141520][Asset Prices]]
  - Green-minus-dirty portfolio
  - Focus on percentiles (25/75 and 10/90)
  - For the firm-specific, focus on the interaction between the climate focus of the CB and some climate-related scores (emission, enviromental, and  emission)

* Methodology

- Dictionary-based approach
  - Gives more control and transparency to handle the dataset
  - Define a threshold to decide when to capture a speech with climate-related topics
    - The decision is to simply capture whenever it is mentioned
- Structural topic model
  - Non-supervised algorithm and creates clusters
  - Choose the number of topics based on the frontier between exclusivity and coherence of the corpus
- Creates indicators of climate focus to run regressions

* Results

- Drivers of climate-related commnunication
  - Institutional dimensions
    - The stronger of CB supervision and independence, the more communication about climate related risks
  - NGFS membership
- Greener firms outperform dirtier firms when FED focuses more on climate-related issues (in terms of daily porfolio return)


* Interesting findings and not categorized stuff

* Critics
