| *Background*                                  | Highly based on textcite:lea_2010_International data                                                                                                                                                                               |
| *Supporting Ideas*                            | Mortgage characteristics vary due to mortgage funding diversity. Banks are better suited to funding *fixed interest rate*.                                                                                                           |
| *Purpose*                                     | Compare mortgage markets according to some dimensions                                                                                                                                                                              |
| *Originality/value (Contribution)*            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| *Relevance*                                   | Presents the mortgage dimensions: size of down payment, term, amortization, recourse, ability to prepay, variability of interest rate. Additionally, provides some information about specific mortgage markets.                    |
| *Design/methodology/approach*                 | Presentation of institutional characteristics.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| *Results*                                     | Basel I and shadow banking system undermined the ability of capital rules to lean against economic conditions. Basel I incentived banks to: (i) finance houses (less risky); (ii) sell mortgages to buy securities issued by GSEs. |
| *(Interesting) Findings*                      | Countries with mortgage financed by banks rely on variable interest rates.                                                                                                                                                         |
| *Research limitations/implications (Critics)* |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| *Uncategorized stuff*                         | After GFC, covered bonds has been advanced as an alternative. US mortgage market are no so consummer friendly as it seems (higher interest rates and short foreclosure time)                                                       |
| *5SS*                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

** Covered bonds


Features:
- Issued by a credit institution subjected to public supervision and regulation
- Bondholder have a priority claim to unsecured creditors
- Credit institutions have to maintain sufficient assets $\Rightarrow$ satisfy the claims of covered bondholders all the time
- Obligations of credit institutions are supervised by public or other independent bodies

How does it works (p. 115):
#+begin_quote
So how does a covered bond work? It is a form of debt that is issued by a financial institution (typically a bank), and is very senior, in the sense that it is bankruptcy remote.
It is “covered” because its cash flows are covered by another asset, such as a mortgage.
Typically, when a mortgage that contributes to covering a bond fails, it is removed from supporting the bond and is replaced with another mortgage.
In the event that the financial institution issuing the covered bond fails, holders of covered bonds are still protected, because by their very design, covered bonds have priority over all other creditors.

** Differences in Government Intervention in Mortgages
"Lea (2010) compares countries in three dimensions: whether they have a government mortgage insurer, whether they provide security guarantees, and whether they have government-sponsored enterprises for mortgages. As it happens, the number of countries with such features outside of the United States is small (Table 8.1)." (Green 2014:116)

Government intervation according to Lea (2010) (note on p.116)

"But Min (2012) makes an important distinction between countries with explicit and implicit guarantees. In particular, he notes that many countries have deposit insurance. If banks issue mortgages are funded with deposits, and deposits are insured by the government, then it is hard to argue that government is not involved in mortgage finance." (Green 2014:116)

Min (2012) argue that there is an implicit guarantee. (note on p.116)

"Basel rules that regulated bank capital, banks were required to hold less capital against mortgages than other types of capital. We will discuss this further in the section on macro-prudential supervision (Table 8.2)." (Green 2014:116)

Basel rules => less capital against mortgages than other types of capital (note on p.116)

"TABLE 8.2" (Green 2014:117)

"More important on a day-to-day basis is that mortgages in the United States cost more than they do in other countries." (Green 2014:118)

Other reason: cost more (note on p.118)
** How Consumer-Friendly Is the US Mortgage
"foreclosure process to move from start to finish is a little more than a year, whereas in Europe it is about two years" (Green 2014:118)

One of the reasons why US mortgages are not so consumer friendly: short foreclosure (note on p.118)

"The question we might ask is why. One answer might be that US mortgages have a free prepayment option, but this option is not so valuable for adjustable rate mortgages. Another is the absence of recourse" (Green 2014:118)

Trying to explain why is more costly: free prepayment option and no recourse (note on p.118)

"Ironically, one of the least consumer-friendly aspects of the European mortgage market—the preponderance of adjustable rate mortgages—may have helped save much of Europe from poor mortgage performanc" (Green 2014:118)

The least consumer-friendly aspect helped Europ from poor mortgage performance: adjustable rate mortgage (note on p.118)

"Default and foreclosure rates in Europe have remained low relative to the United States, even as that continent's economic recovery has been exceptionally weak." (Green 2014:118)

Default and foreclosure in US is higher than in Europe (note on p.118)
** Size of Mortgage Markets
"The combination of house prices, underwriting incentives, and tax policies explains a great deal of differences in mortgage market sizes across countries. The most common metric for comparing mortgage market sizes across countries is the Mortgage-Debt Outstanding (MDO) to GDP ra" (Green 2014:119)
** Mortgages and Macro-Prudential Supervision
"Two important things conspired to undermine the ability of bank capital rules to lean against economic conditions: Basel I18 and the shadow banking system." (Green 2014:120)

Characteristics that reduced the hability of capital rules: Basel I and shadow banking syste, (note on p.120)

"Basel I was a set of risk-based capital rules that determined whether banks were or were not sufficiently capitalized. There were two basic rules; Tier 1 capital (which consists of paid up capital and retained earnings) under Basel I has to be greater than 8 percent of risk weighted assets. Lower risk weights mean that a bank needs to put up less capital." (Green 2014:120)

What Basel I had done: lower risk -> less capital (note on p.120)

"Risk weights that were assigned to different assets are presented in Table 8.3. Residential mortgages receive preference over other types of loans, and GSEbacked mortgage-backed securities receive preference over whole mortgages. This gave lenders a strong regulatory incentive to (1) finance homes and (2) sell mortgages of their balance sheet to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and then buy back the securities issued by the GSEs" (Green 2014:120)

Basel I gave the incentives to finance homes and sell mortgages to buy securities issued by GSE. (note on p.120)

"Beyond the question of whether the risk weights are correct, they have the fundamental problem of being static. In a period such as 2006, it was becoming quite clear that mortgages were becoming dangerous, not just in the United States, but also in Spain, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, as house prices rose to a point where only a small number of people could afford them." (Green 2014:120)

The main problem with Basel is the *static design*: mortgages were becoming dangerous. (note on p.120)

"Beyond the issue of bank capital, though, is the lack of regulation of the shadow banking sector and off-balance sheet investment vehicles. Shadow banks are institutions that are financial intermediaries that do not have access to central bank funding; in exchange for not getting that privilege, they have operated without regulatory oversight" (Green 2014:121)

Other issue: lacj of regulation of the shadow banking sector (note on p.121)

"More prosaically, some countries employed macro-prudential supervision through LTV ratio rules. South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, and China all reduced maximum LTV standards in the midst of housing booms in order to attempt to keep the booms from creating debt overhangs." (Green 2014:121)

Some countries had employed maximum LTV standards. (note on p.121)

"Kim (2012) and Wong et al. (2011) provide evidence that using LTV maximums to lean against housing booms and busts can be an effective policy" (Green 2014:121)

Further reading for LTM effectiveness. (note on p.121)
