* Specifics comments

** The explanation of the business cycle
- *Plurality of causes:* The business cycle are not explained by only one factor
  + Frequently, theorists differs on emphasis of some factors and not in the enumeration of those factors
- *Classifications of causal factors:*
  + Causes and Conditions
  + Controlable and uncontrolable
    - A factor could be controlable but it is not desired to control it
  + Originates within or outside the economic system
- *Endogenous and exogenous theories:* Serious theory may not be based on fully endogenous or exogenous variables
  + _Exogenous:_ External disturbances
  + _Endogenous:_ Movements explained economically
- *Inherent instability in the economic system:* it is possible to fit external disturbances to this endogenous tendency
- *Mechanical analogy:* Economic system is compared to a pendulum
  + Structure: Turns shocks to a regular swing (example)
- It is more important to study peculiar structure of the system and its responses to external shocks than to look for regularities in the occurrence of these shocks

** Method of the following analysis

- *Principle of selection:* Theories are presented in a systemic and not chronological order
- *Heads of analysis:*
  + Explanation of the prosperity (upswing)
  + Explanation of the crisis (upper-turing point)
  + Explanation of the Depressions (downswing)
  + Explanation of the revival (lower-turing point)
  + Reasons given for recurrence, periodicity
  + Internacional implication
