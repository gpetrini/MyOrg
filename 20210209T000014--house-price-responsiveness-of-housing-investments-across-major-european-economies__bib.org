| *Background*                                  | Residential investment is way less analyzed than house prices                                                                                                                                               |
| *Supporting Ideas*                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| *Purpose*                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| *Originality/value (Contribution)*            |                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| *Relevance*                                   | Point out that previous empirical studies connecting costs shifters and residential investment are inconclusive and house prices is the main determinant of new houses (elasticity ranging from o.5 to 2.3) |
| *Design/methodology/approach*                 | Error correction and country specific model                                                                                                                                                                 |
| *Sample*                                      | Six European countries (1970 - 2009): Germany,  France,  Italy,  Spain,  the Netherlands and the United Kingdom                                                                                             |
| *Variables*                                   | Real residential investment, Real GDP, Real long term interest rate and proxies for land prices                                                                                                             |
| *Results*                                     | Germany has the strongest response to house prices while Italy show the lowest one                                                                                                                          |
| *(Interesting) Findings*                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| *Research limitations/implications (Critics)* |                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| *Uncategorized stuff*                         | Residential investment is highly inertial in some countries which may justify the lag selection order in VEC paper.                                                                                         |
| *5SS*                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

** Specific comments

Residential investment function is estimated as follows:

#+BEGIN_latex
\begin{equation}
RHI = RHI(GPD(+), INT (-), LAND(-))
\end{equation}
#+END_latex
The authors report the expected sign in their estimations.
LAND is computed using dwellings price and the deflator of residential investment.
