  abstract = {The central role of the housing market in the recent recession raised a series of questions about similar episodes throughout economic history. Were the underlying causes of housing and mortgage crises the same in earlier episodes? Has the onset and spread of crises changed over time? How have previous policy interventions either damaged or improved long-run market performance and stability? This volume begins to answer these questions, providing a much-needed context for understanding recent events by examining how historical housing and mortgage markets worked\textemdash and how they sometimes failed. Renowned economic historians Eugene N. White, Kenneth Snowden, and Price Fishback survey the foundational research on housing crises, comparing that of the 1930s to that of the early 2000s in order to authoritatively identify what contributed to each crisis. Later chapters explore notable historical experiences with mortgage securitization and the role that federal policy played in the surge in home ownership between 1940 and 1960. By providing a broad historical overview of housing and mortgage markets, the volume offers valuable new insights to inform future policy debates.},

Beginning with the broad theoretical arguments around the idea of "Varieties of Capitalism", the book then goes on to focus on specific empirical controversies, before finally considering recent attempts at rethinking this influential framework.   The Debating Varieties of Capitalism Reader is the perfect guide to understanding this set of ideas that have changed the way we look at comparative political economy.},

Based on a range of econometric analyses, it also investigates whether these housing-related policies achieve their objectives in an efficient and equitable way and whether there are any side effects on other aspects of housing markets or on the wider economy. One main finding is that badly-designed policies can have substantial negative effects on the economy, for instance by increasing the level and volatility of real house prices and preventing people from moving easily to follow employment opportunities. The paper makes some recommendations for the design of efficient and equitable housing policies that can improve the functioning of housing markets and contribute to macroeconomic stability and growth.},

Direct and indirect government intervention in the housing market through spatial planning and land policy, regulation and supervision of housing associations, rent policy and financial guarantees, generous mortgage interest deductibility and other explicit or implicit subsidies have led progressively to entrenched structural problems, which have negative consequences for the economy as a whole. Given the relatively rigid supply, price developments have been determined in particular by fiscal incentives and demand factors, under which innovations in mortgage financing have played a particularly important role, so that, compared to other euro area members, the Netherlands has relatively high levels of leveraged housing wealth. We conclude with possible reforms that would increase the efficiency of the Dutch housing market by addressing distortions in a gradual fashion while still achieving social policy objectives.},

Harrod-style investment and short-run wage-led demand generate counterfactual clockwise cycles. Financial dynamics involving the equity valuation ratio are considered. Both the ratio and equity price inflation demonstrate positive own-feedback. The ratio can be stabilized cyclically by capital stock growth and/or rising household net worth or debt. Debt accumulation persists (or `overshoots') after equity price inflation switches to a negative rate. A Minsky-style model with Harrodian investment can be stabilized by accumulation of business debt.},

  abstract = {Ethical attitudes and behaviour are complex. This complexity extends to the influencers operating at different levels both outside and within the organisation, and in different combinations for different individuals. There is hence a growing need to understand the proximal and distal influencers of ethical attitudes, and how these operate in concert at the individual, organisational, and societal levels. Few studies have attempted to combine these main research streams and systematically examine their combined impact. The minority of studies that have taken a combined approach have often done so using conventional statistical and analytical techniques which imply linearity between variables\textemdash a situation that rarely exists in business settings and is likely to lead to simplistic or even erroneous conclusions. Applying a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis approach, this paper reports on the mutual and simultaneous influence of individual demographic factors (gender, education), as well as proximal and distal factors stemming from within and outside the work environment (e.g. treatment by one's supervisor, country-level indicators of corruption perceptions) to understand individuals' ethical views within the workplace (n = 525). The multiple configurations that emerged reveal the complex nature of influencers of ethical attitudes, and reinforce the view that ``one size does not fit all''. We discuss these implications together with managerial recommendations and future research directions.},

Housing is a central aspect of financialization. The financialization of mortgage markets demands that not just homes but also homeowners become viewed as financially exploitable. It is exemplified by the securitization of mortgage loans, but also by the use of credit scoring and risk-based pricing. In the past century, mortgage markets were transformed from being a `facilitating market' for homeowners in need of credit to one increasingly facilitating global investment. Since mortgage markets are both local consumer markets and global investment markets, the dynamics of financialization and globalization directly relate homeowners to global investors thereby increasing the volatility in mortgage markets, as the current crisis shows all too well.},

We survey the existing evidence, which suggests that inflated house-price expectations across the economy played a central role in driving both the demand for and the supply of mortgage credit before the crisis. The great misnomer of the 2008 crisis is that it was not a subprime crisis but rather a middle-class crisis. Inflated house-price expectations led households across all income groups, especially the middle class, to increase their demand for housing and mortgage leverage. Similarly, banks lent against increasing collateral values and underestimated the risk of defaults. We highlight how these emerging facts have essential implications for policy.},

Using data for 20 industrial countries over the period 1970Q1\textendash 2012Q2 and a discrete-time Weibull duration model, we find that the likelihood of the end of a housing boom or a housing bust increases over time. Additionally, we show that the different phases of the housing market cycle are strongly dependent on the economic activity, but credit market conditions are particularly important in the case of housing booms. The empirical findings also indicate that although housing booms have similar lengths in European and non-European countries, housing busts are typically shorter in European countries. The use of a more flexible specification for the hazard function that is based on cubic splines suggests that it evolves in a nonlinear way. From a policy perspective, our study can be useful for predicting the timing and the length of housing boom\textendash bust cycles. Moreover, it highlights the importance of monetary policy by influencing lending rates and affecting the likelihood of occurrence of housing booms.},

This is done using the methodology of Principal Component Analysis, which can relate the information from different countries to its common sources. We also test for a structural change in the premium risk series in 2003, by means of structural break tests. We find that push factors do play the predominant role in explaining country risk changes of our selected peripherical countries and that there was indeed a substantial general reduction in country risk premia after 2003, confirming that the external constraints of the periphery were significantly loosened by more favorable conditions in the international economy in the more recent period. The results are in line both with the view that cycles in peripherical economies are broadly subordinated to global financial cycles, in but also that such external conditions substantially improved compared to the 1990s.},

  abstract = {A broadly accepted view contends that the 2007-09 financial crisis in the U.S. was caused by an expansion in the supply of credit to subprime borrowers during the 2001- 2006 credit boom, leading to the spike in defaults and foreclosures that sparked the crisis. We use a large administrative panel of credit file data to examine the evolution of household debt and defaults between 1999 and 2013. Our findings suggest an alternative narrative that challenges the large role of subprime credit in the crisis. We show that credit growth between 2001 and 2007 was concentrated in the prime segment, and debt to high risk borrowers was virtually constant for all debt categories during this period. The rise in mortgage defaults during the crisis was concentrated in the middle of the credit score distribution, and mostly attributable to real estate investors. We argue that previous analyses confounded life cycle debt demand of borrowers who were young at the start of the boom with an expansion in credit supply over that period.},

The results show that an expansionary monetary policy shock does not have a significant effect on income inequality due to the existence of opposite channels, whereas it increases wealth inequality mainly through the portfolio channel.},

These include differences in: (i) the underlying components \textendash{} financial asset prices and capital flows for the global financial cycle (GFCy) versus credit and property prices for the domestic financial cycle (DFC); (ii) their empirical properties \textendash{} the GFCy has a shorter duration and is primarily linked with traditional business cycles, while the DFC has a longer duration and is predominantly linked with medium-term business cycles; and (iii) the policy focus \textendash{} ``dilemma versus trilemma'' for the GFCy, ``lean versus clean'' for the DFC. Despite these differences, the two cycles tend to come together around crises. Finally, we show that traditional GFCy measures mainly reflect developments in advanced economies and that a simple alternative measure is much more relevant for emerging market economies.},

Firstly, an unemployment benefits system organizes the distribution of the wage bill between employed and unemployed workers, the latter receiving an amount of money corresponding to the subsistence level. Secondly, only individuals with an income above the subsistence level build savings. The combination of these two hypotheses gives rise to an autonomous consumption expenditure whose rate of growth is given by the demographic rate of growth. As a consequence, the rate of capital accumulation spontaneously converges towards the demographic rate of growth (supermultiplier effect), a dynamics that gives a solution to one of the two Harrodian instability problems. The third hypothesis corresponds to the entrepreneurs' attempts to adjust investment in order to restore the normal rate of capacity utilization. Whereas such assumption usually generates knife-edge instability, we show here that this instability can be eliminated by the stabilizing properties of the supermultiplier. Moreover, the attempts to adjust investment enable to restore the normal rate of capacity utilization. In summary, the model offers a simple, simultaneous solution to the two Harrodian instability problems.},

We first develop a `Keynesian' overlapping generations framework assuming that people borrow when they are young and service their debt (interests and principal) in the following periods. Defaults on the principal are also taken into account. We then analyze the theoretical properties of the equilibriums (multiplier effect, stability conditions) resulting from the introduction of this framework in three types of models that differ in regard of who are the debtors and who are the creditors: workers can borrow from capitalists (essay 1) or from their peer (essay 2); capitalists can borrow from their peer (essay 3).},

  abstract = {Recent contributions to the comparative political economy literature claim that liberal market economies are vulnerable to asset booms and busts because of financial deregulation, shrinking welfare states and a political ideology emphasising financial self-sufficiency. This article examines the rapid expansion of mortgage lending in three coordinated market economies (CMEs): Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands. This expansion is puzzling given that all three countries are CMEs with generous welfare states. Yet the pattern of mortgage lending resembles the Anglo-Saxon or liberal market economies (LMEs) more than other CMEs. The article argues that mortgage bubbles in the small CMEs emerged as the unintended outcome of pairing neoliberal programmes to expand home ownership with collectivist housing institutions. This resulted in supply restrictions and rising property values which saddled households with extraordinarily high mortgage debts. In short, mortgage credit bubbles are not unique to Anglo-liberal welfare states and may have different origins.},

One main finding is that badly-designed policies can have substantial negative effects on the economy, for instance by increasing the level and volatility of real house prices and preventing people from moving easily to follow employment opportunities. The paper makes some recommendations for the design of efficient and equitable housing policies that can improve the functioning of housing markets and contribute to macroeconomic stability and growth.},

  abstract = {The global financial crisis has made it painfully clear that powerful psychological forces are imperiling the wealth of nations today. From blind faith in ever-rising housing prices to plummeting confidence in capital markets, "animal spirits" are driving financial events worldwide. In this book, acclaimed economists George Akerlof and Robert Shiller challenge the economic wisdom that got us into this mess, and put forward a bold new vision that will transform economics and restore prosperity. Akerlof and Shiller reassert the necessity of an active government role in economic policymaking by recovering the idea of animal spirits, a term John Maynard Keynes used to describe the gloom and despondence that led to the Great Depression and the changing psychology that accompanied recovery. Like Keynes, Akerlof and Shiller know that managing these animal spirits requires the steady hand of government--simply allowing markets to work won't do it. In rebuilding the case for a more robust, behaviorally informed Keynesianism, they detail the most pervasive effects of animal spirits in contemporary economic life--such as confidence, fear, bad faith, corruption, a concern for fairness, and the stories we tell ourselves about our economic fortunes--and show how Reaganomics, Thatcherism, and the rational expectations revolution failed to account for them.Animal Spirits offers a road map for reversing the financial misfortunes besetting us today. Read it and learn how leaders can channel animal spirits--the powerful forces of human psychology that are afoot in the world economy today.},

This article addresses this question by testing whether income inequality in OECD countries was related to events linked to the spread of communism\textemdash revolutions and  Soviet interventions\textemdash around the world. We argue that the threat of the spread of communism acted as an incentive for the elites and governments to keep economic inequality low. This article provides an empirical contribution to the recent literature on inequality, which highlights the  role of domestic institutions but ignores the role of the Cold War in redistributing income. We find a robust relationship between income inequality and the distance to communist events. The results, reinforced by cases studied, suggest that the spread of communism fostered income redistribution  deals between domestic elites and workers. Finally, we show that these effects were reinforced by strong unions and the presence of strong communist parties.},

Although the quality of the underlying data limits the precision of the estimates, the present paper aims at analysing the fundamental factors behind these evolutions. The analysis presented here assesses whether the observed price dynamics may be attributed to a pure expectation bubble phenomenon or to the large changes in financial and demographic factors. This is done by means of a structural model of the demand and supply sides of the housing market with an error-correction process.When taking into account a standard set of macroeconomic variables, our estimates imply that residential property prices in France and Spain were approximately 20\% above the level explained by their fundamentals by the end of 2008. When demographic and financial factors such as the borrowing capacity are taken on board, the degree of overvaluation is drastically reduced. The adjustment path to equilibrium is slightly faster in France than in Spain, but both countries display significant downward rigidity in prices.},

The analysis is conducted in the framework of a VECM, since this allows accounting for endogeneity between the variables. Our results imply that a long term relationship between investment and subsidies exists, making subsidies an adequate tool to influence residential investment and hence the business cycle. In addition, a disaggregated approach taking into account several different types of fiscalmeasures highlights that tax and interest rate subsidies are the most efficient fiscal tools for influencing residential investment.When accounting for financial factors by means of households' borrowing capacity, we find that the latter also impacts residential investment positively.Moreover, this alternative specification underlines the robustness of the above mentioned results, as it confirms subsidies as the most efficient measure to influence residential investment.},

We intend to spell out if income inequality was indeed reduced in the latest years. To accomplish that goal, the data for the analysis are issued from Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domic\'ilios (PNAD); also by means of income concentration index, which is divided into 5 features: labor income, pensions and public pensions, private pensions, rents, allowances, grants. In that regard, it covers that Brazilian income inequality jumped from 0.5826 (2002) to 0.5241 (2011). Among other things, from the results obtained is the important fact that by decreasing the parts the income inequality is reduced as a whole, regardless the composition effect is taken to be harmless. The labor income revealed to play an important role in reducing the Gini index by means of effect-concentration (55.83\%), and other incomes, which were responsible for reducing 20.72\%. The rents and pensions officers contributed 18.07\% for reducing the Gini index (G). Furthermore, the effects with respect the other incomes have undoubted influence on the reduction of Brazilian income inequality, especially in the Northeast.},

  abstract = {There has been a major shift within macroeconomic policy over the past three decades or so, in terms of the relative importance given to monetary policy and to fiscal policy. The former is gaining considerably in importance, while the latter is being so much downgraded that it is rarely discussed at least in academic circles these days. There are, of course, exceptions to this general statement. The onset of the `great recession' prompted governments to initiate fiscal measures that avoided another `great depression'. However, that was rather short-lived. It is now the case that a number of governments have resumed their hostility to fiscal policy as a stabilization instrument. In Arestis and Sawyer (1998, 2003a, 2004), we critically examined the significance of this shift in terms of monetary policy, which led us to question the effectiveness of interest rates now being used as the main instrument of monetary policy. In the same paper, but also in Arestis and Sawyer (2003b, 2006, 2010), we explored the role of fiscal policy, and argued that in the `new consensus in macroeconomics' within which macroeconomics in general and monetary policy in particular is generally discussed, there is barely any mention of fiscal policy.1},

Consequently, we propose to endogenize the volume of bank credit by paying special attention to those variables that are related to the real estate market, which can be considered as key to the evolution of bank credit. Our theoretical hypothesis is tested by means of a sample of nine economies of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) from 1970 to 2011.

In this context, one relationship, which still remains unclear, is the relationship between the housing and the labour markets. Some research has been undertaken to support the hypothesis that high rates of homeownership lead to high unemployment via increases in the reservation wage. However, further research is needed to address the possible implications of the institutional settings of the labour market in the dynamics of the housing market. The aim of this paper is to bring some light on the link between both markets. In particular, this contribution explains how the housing cycle could be ``amplified'' via a new channel, that is, economic precariousness, which is closely related to job insecurity.

Interest rate policy should be such that the real rate of interest is in line with trend rate of growth in the economy. Fiscal and monetary policies, though, should be coordinated closely. Major central bank cooperation and intervention in the foreign exchange market is necessary to control the exchange rate. Regional and industrial policies to create the required capacity are important, along with incomes policies, to contain inflationary/deflationary pressures. Distribution of income and wealth is another important policy dimension in view of its importance in terms of the great recession.},

  abstract = {The importance of the housing market and residential investment was highlighted by OECD (2000b), suggesting that `In the United States\ldots{} the contribution of real estate developments to the current economic expansion has been emphasised recently' (p. 169). In fact, it is argued that `Over the 1996\textendash 99 period, the growth of housing wealth in excess of income growth in the United States may have contributed 0.4 percentage point to the total drop of the household saving ratio of some 2.4 percentage points' (p. 179). The same OECD study concludes that `The link between house price developments and movements in aggregate demand suggests that monitoring developments in property markets can provide a useful input to the setting of economic policy' (OECD, 2000b, p. 181; see also, Greenspan, 1999).1 The boom of the housing market since the burst of the equity bubble has raised some concerns. Greenspan (2004c) emphasised the importance of `preventive actions' which `are required sooner rather than later' in order to `fend off possible future systemic difficulties, which we assess as likely if GSE expansion continues unabated' (p. 4).2 Especially so, since `the existence, or even the perception, of government backing undermines the effectiveness of market discipline' (p. 4). It is, therefore, suggested that `the GSE regulator must have authority similar to that of the banking regulator', but also `GSEs need to be limited in the issuance of GSE debt and in the purchase of assets, both mortgages and nonmortgages, that they hold' (p. 5).},

How much priority should be given to housing in view of the limited resources in less-developed countries? What are housing benefits in economic development vis-\`a-vis other economic investments? These questions have generated heated debates, both in the literature on development problems and in planning and practice in the 1950s and 1960s. This paper draws on the accumulated body of knowledge resulting from past experiences in research and policy to revisit the earlier debates, survey the main lines of argument and reassess the economic potential of housing. It then attempts to generate broad policy considerations. The main contention of this paper is that in light of past and present evidence, the housing sector needs to be given serious consideration in economic growth strategies.},

We study the impact of the exposure to real estate risk on stock demand. We find that, besides information and transaction costs and risk aversion, housing wealth is a key determinant of stockownership: households facing real estate risk tend to moderate their investments in stocks. This behaviour, called ''temperance'',may thus contribute to explain why people own so few stocks, in particular in France (stock participation puzzle).},

  abstract = {We propose a theory of asset pricing based on heterogeneous agents who continually adapt their expectations to the market that these expectations aggregatively create. And we explore the implications of this theory computationally using our Santa Fe artificial stock market. Asset markets, we argue, have a recursive nature in that agents' expectations are formed on the basis of their anticipations of other agents' expectations, which precludes expectations being formed by deductive means. Instead traders continually hypothesize-continually explore-expectational models, buy or sell on the basis of those that perform best, and confirm or discard these according to their performance. Thus individual beliefs or expectations become endogenous to the market, and constantly compete within an ecology of others' beliefs or expectations. The ecology of beliefs co-evolves over time. Computer experiments with this endogenous-expectations market explain one of the more striking puzzles in finance: that market traders often believe in such concepts as technical trading, market psychology, and bandwagon effects, while academic theorists believe in market efficiency and a lack of speculative opportunities. Both views, we show, are correct, but within different regimes. Within a regime where investors explore alternative expectational models at a low rate, the market settles into the rational-expectations equilibrium of the efficient-market literature. Within a regime where the rate of exploration of alternative expectations is higher, the market self-organizes into a complex pattern. It acquires a rich psychology, technical trading emerges, temporary bubbles and crashes occur, and asset prices and trading volume show statistical features-in particular, GARCH behavior-characteristic of actual market data.},

This approach could be contrasted with the ``European'' model based on renting houses delivered mainly by the state. The 2007 crisis revealed that these differences bear far-reaching consequences not only for economic stability but also for aggregate demand. The aim of this paper is to analyze the macroeconomic differences between privately funded and state funded investment in the housing market. The following hypothesis is tested: public funding decreases debt burden in the economy and increases aggregate spending by households. The effects depend on the share of the rentier owned houses in the total housing stock. For the purpose of the research Post Keynesian stock-flow-consistent model is employed, aiming to extend the SFC model of the housing sector developed by G. Zezza in the article ``U.S. Growth, the Housing Market and the Distribution of Income'', Journal of Post Keynesian Economics, vol. 30 (2008), n. 3, pp. 379-405.},

  abstract = {This work aims to study the relationship between economic growth and income distribution. From the theoretical models of Cambridge, neo-Kaleckian and supermultiplier it is possible to establish two types of effects. The first, called level effect is predicted in all models, and establishes a direct relationship from the the wage share to the level of output which occurs via changes in the components of demand. The second, called growth effect occurs only in the neo-Kaleckian models, and is the causality relationship from the wage share to output growth. From this typology, we analyze the presence of these two effects in the empirical literature. It follows that there is no evidence of growth effect in this literature, but only level effect. Similarly, estimates indicate that, for the Brazilian economy the only statistically significant relationship found is a level effect, starting from the economic stability in 1994.},

  abstract = {Post-Keynesian growth models started incorporating household wealth dynamics as an important aspect of the relationship between growth and income distribution. Following these lines, this paper suggests a model in which household consumption decision is determined by a dynamic adjustment of wealth to a targeted level. We also suggest that household's targeted level of wealth takes into account the average income that they earn over a period of ten years. We then run an empirical estimation using microlevel data for wealth and wage of US households available in the PSID (Panel Study on Income Dynamics) Database. We find that the model yields statistically significant results for most income and age groups. We also observe that the target wealth to wage ratio is not constant across groups of income and age. This ratio tends to increase with income and is actually negative for the lowest income bracket. This empirical analysis then suggests that there is evidence for claiming that household debt-financed consumption is an autonomous component of demand and can be incorporated into a demand-led growth model to explain the trajectory of the US economy in the period under analysis.},

For conventional banks, we argue that during periods of rising risk in the economy, investors with higher risk aversion prefer bank deposits as a haven compared to other asset classes, causing conventional banks to be flushed with excess liquidity, which is then disposed of in the form of risky loans. This may create asset price bubbles and a further increase in the overall risk of the economy. For Islamic banks, we build a theoretical model with a religious conscious customer base who demands products with religious compliance. The increased self-regulatory environment faced by Islamic banks on the backdrop of religious compliance helps reducing the influx of liquidity and conversion into risky loans during periods of heightened macroeconomic shocks. Using bank-level data from 20 Muslim-dominated countries for the period from 2000 to 2015, we test the propositions of our theoretical model. We find that the macroeconomic risk has a significant, positive impact on conventional bank deposits, while its impact on Islamic banks' deposits is either negative or significantly lower than their conventional counterparts.},

To provide an answer to this question, we start from a visualization of the importance of the minimum wage in PNAD's income distribution and from a hypothesis that the underestimation of incomes in the PNAD surveys is concentrated in those families whose incomes do not follow the minimum wage. We then derive an equation to explain the difference between household income growth in the PNAD and household consumption growth in the national accounts as a function of the change in the minimum wage. Our empirical estimates of this equation suggest that the behavior of the minimum wage has been an important component in the explanation of differences in income growth between the PNAD and the GDP accounts.},

  abstract = {This paper presents new data on the depth and penetration of mortgage markets across countries. There is a large variation across both dimensions of mortgage market development, across countries, but also -- in terms of depth -- within countries. Mortgage markets seem to develop only at relatively high levels of gross domestic product per capita. Policies associated with financial system development are also associated with mortgage market development, including price stability and the efficiency of contractual and information frameworks. The development of the insurance sector and the stock market, sources of long-term funding, is strongly associated with mortgage market development, while government subsidies and support are not. A benchmarking exercise compares the actual values of mortgage market development to values predicted by structural country factors and shows a large variation across countries and over time in the gap between predicted and actual values, related to specific policies but also mortgage boom and bust cycles.},

  abstract = {In contrast to much of the political economy literature, this article explores acts of refusal that obstruct attempts to impose austerity measures on advanced industrial democracies. It thereby complements a literature that has thus far focused far more upon the (apparently unobstructed) imposition of austerity. In doing so, it uses two typically `low-resistance' countries \textendash{} Japan and the UK \textendash as least-likely cases and finds that austerity is rarely uncontested. Using fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis, it highlights the `causal recipes' sufficient for both (1) anti-austerity activity to have a significant impact on austerity proposals and (2) the smooth (unobstructed) imposition of austerity. The politics of austerity is shown to be better understood as an iterative interaction between proposals for austerity and the acts of refusal they encounter. These obstacles to austerity appear more straightforward to activate effectively in Japan's coordinated model of capitalism, whilst the UK's liberal market economy tends to generate more innovative forms of dissent that (if they are sufficiently militant) provide an alternative route towards the obstruction of austerity.},

The study includes economic growth, short-term interest rate, and population as additional covariates. Empirical results show that a positive shock to EPU leads to decrease in housing prices while the EPU shows only a weak response to housing price shocks. The results imply that EPU has robust predictive power for the housing market, implying the need for evaluating the associated risks. The panel Granger causality tests indicate strong and robust Granger causality from the EPU to housing prices, but not vice versa. The causal links also indicate that the effect of the EPU on is direct rather than indirect through other variables. Based on these outcomes, policy recommendations are made for real estate agents, portfolio managers, and policy makers.},

While there is a vast literature on housing models using two-dimensional panel data, there are few papers using multi-dimensional panels. This chapter focuses on housing models, residential mobility and location choice models derived from discrete choice theory, utilizing multi-dimensional panels. Examples include nested or hierarchical error components models, where a house is located in a street, within a block, within a city, within a county, etc. This chapter introduces some basic concepts of utility functions and discrete choice models used for hedonic functions, and residential mobility and location choices. Then it surveys some significant papers on multi-dimensional models of residential mobility and location choice. The paper concludes by surveying a few papers on dynamic housing models. It shows that both spatial and temporal dimensions in dynamic systems should be included for hedonic housing models and discrete models of residential location in a multi-dimensional framework. However, the inclusion of these multiple dimensions greatly complicates the specification and modeling of such systems.},

Our cointegration results show no evidence of cointegration between real house price and rent in the western region. However, there is strong evidence of cointegration in the eastern and northern regions. This confirms the existence of housing submarkets in Greater Sydney, and an indication of housing price bubbles in Western Sydney. Further, the formal BSADF bubble tests reveal strong evidence of explosive price bubbles in Western Sydney, while there is no comparable evidence for the other regions of Sydney, which further highlights the importance of submarket analysis. Importantly, the DOLS results suggest that housing investment plays a major role in the build-up of housing bubbles in Western Sydney, supporting Shiller's Psychological Theory of bubbles which posits that bubbles occur via the speculative behaviour of investors. The implications of the findings are also discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper develops an agent-based model of the UK housing market to study the impact of macroprudential policies on key housing market indicators. This approach enables us to tackle the heterogeneity in this market by modelling the individual behaviour and interactions of first-time buyers, home owners, buy-to-let investors, and renters from the bottom up, and observe the resulting aggregate dynamics in the property and credit markets. The model is calibrated using a large selection of micro-data, mostly from household surveys and housing market data sources. We perform a series of comparative statics exercises to investigate the impact of the size of the rental/buy-to-let sector and different types of buy-to-let investors on housing booms and busts. The results suggest that an increase in the size of the buy-to-let sector may amplify house price cycles and increase house price volatility. Furthermore, in order to illustrate the effects of macroprudential policies on several housing market indicators, we implement a loan-to-income portfolio limit. We find that this policy attenuates the house price cycle.},

  abstract = {This paper develops an agent-based model of the UK housing market to study the impact of macroprudential policies on key housing market indicators. This approach enables us to tackle the heterogeneity in this market by modelling the individual behaviour and interactions of first-time buyers, home owners, buy-to-let investors, and renters from the bottom up, and observe the resulting aggregate dynamics in the property and credit markets. The model is calibrated using a large selection of micro-data, mostly from household surveys and housing market data sources. We perform a series of comparative statics exercises to investigate the impact of the size of the rental/buy-to-let sector and different types of buy-to-let investors on housing booms and busts. The results suggest that an increase in the size of the buy-to-let sector may amplify house price cycles and increase house price volatility.Furthermore, in order to illustrate the effects of macroprudential policies on several housing market indicators, we implement a loan-to-income portfolio limit. We find that this policy attenuates the house price cycle.},

  author = {Barba, Aldo and Pivetti, Massimo},
  year = {2009},
  abstract = {The article analyses the rise in household indebtedness from the point of view of its causes and long-run macroeconomic implications. The analysis is focussed on the US case. Differently from life-cycle interpretations of the phenomenon, and from interpretations in terms of erratic deviations of current income flows from their long-run trend, the rising household debt is viewed as the outcome of persistent changes in income distribution and growing income inequalities. Through household debt, low wages appear to have been brought to coexist with relatively high levels of aggregate demand, thus providing the solution to the contradiction between the necessity of high and rising consumption levels, for the growth of the system's actual output, and a framework of antagonistic conditions of distribution which keeps within limits the real income of the vast majority of society. The question of the long-run sustainability of this substitution of loans for wages is finally discussed. Reprinted by permission of Oxford University Press},

As in Goodwin's cyclical growth model, b can be interpreted as a Lotka-Volterra predator variable and u as prey. In a phase diagram, dynamics around the u=0 schedule respond to effective demand that econometric estimation (1948-2002) shows to be profit-led. Distributive dynamics around the b=0 curve demonstrate a long-term profit squeeze. Across cycles, the real wage and labor productivity grow at 0.57 per cent per quarter, holding the labor share broadly stable. Modeling the cycle in the (u, b) plane provides a parsimonious description of demand and distributive dynamics, consistent with the macroeconomics embedded in the work of Kalecki, Steindl, Goodwin and many subsequent authors.},

The accepted narrative about the pre-crisis boom is that some liberal countries relied on domestic consumption to fuel economic growth, and on household debt to fuel this consumption. In this, they contrasted with coordinated economies. While eventually unsustainable, the growth strategy was politically necessary to maintain middle-class living standards in the context of increasing income inequality. In this article, I take these contentions to the data. Economic evidence from 1995\textendash 2007 and political data from the Comparative Manifesto Project Database undermine this received wisdom: while household debt increased in the liberal countries, it does not differentiate this particular growth model. Further, there is no evidence that politicians in liberal countries advocate different economic policies, including those concerning borrowing, to claim credit and stay in power. Differences in the importance of finance between countries, however, suggest a more elite-driven divergence.},

In The Rise and Fall of the U.S. Mortgage and Credit Markets, renowned finance expert James Barth offers a comprehensive examination of the mortgage meltdown. Together with a team of economists at the Milken Institute, he explores the shock waves that have rippled through the entire financial sector and the real economy. Deploying an incredibly detailed and extensive set of data, the book offers in-depth analysis of the mortgage meltdown and the resulting worldwide financial crisis. This authoritative volume explores what went wrong in every critical area, including securitization, loan origination practices, regulation and supervision, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, leverage and accounting practices, and of course, the rating agencies. The authors explain the steps the government has taken to address the crisis thus far, arguing that we have yet to address the larger issues.

We exploit a new household-level dataset that covers the joint distributions of debt, income, and wealth in the United States over the past seven decades. The data show that increased borrowing by middle-class families with low income growth played a central role in rising indebtedness. Debt-to-income ratios have risen most dramatically for households between the 50th and 90th percentiles of the income distribution. While their income growth was low, middle-class families borrowed against the sizable housing wealth gains from rising home prices. Home equity borrowing accounts for about half of the increase in U.S. household debt between the 1970s and 2007. The resulting debt increase made balance sheets more sensitive to income and house price fluctuations and turned the American middle class into the epicenter of growing financial fragility.},

We find sound evidence in favour of a cointegrating relation, in which both wealth components display the expected, positive effect on households` consumption. In particular, our results point to a lower marginal propensity to consume out of housing than out of non housing net worth, with a respective size laying in the range of 1.5-2 and 4-6 cents. Following the estimate of a vector error correction model, we discuss the role played by transitory and permanent shocks in driving changes in the variables we consider. We have found that both consumption and wealth respond almost exclusively to permanent shocks, which are the sole determinants of the common stochastic trend in our theoretical set-up. As a result, we are confident that our estimates of wealth coefficients in the cointegrating vector match very closely the true long run marginal propensity to consume for Italian households.},

  abstract = {Post Keynesian macrodynamic models make various assumptions about the normal rate of capacity utilization. Those rooted in the Classical and neo-Keynesian traditions assume the normal rate is fixed, whereas Kaleckian models treat it as a variable that is endogenous to the actual rate of capacity utilization. This paper contributes to the debate about the normal rate of capacity utilization by developing a model of strong or genuine hysteresis, in which firms make discrete decisions about the normal rate depending on the degree of uncertainty about demand conditions. An agent-based model based on empirical analysis of 25 sectors of the US economy is used to show that hysteresis can cause variation in the normal rate of capacity utilization within a subset of the range of observed variation in the actual capacity utilization rate. This suggests that the economy exhibits both constancy and (endogenous) variability in the normal rate of utilization over different ranges of variation in the actual rate. More broadly speaking, the genuine hysteresis model is shown to provide the basis for a synthesis of Post Keynesian macrodynamics that draws on both the Classical/neo-Keynesian and Kaleckian modeling traditions.},

  abstract = {The average cash-to-assets ratio for U.S. industrial firms more than doubles from 1980 to 2006. A measure of the economic importance of this increase is that at the end of the sample period, the average firm can retire all debt obligations with its cash holdings. Cash ratios increase because firms' cash flows become riskier. In addition, firms change: They hold fewer inventories and receivables and are increasingly R\&D intensive. While the precautionary motive for cash holdings plays an important role in explaining the increase in cash ratios, we find no consistent evidence that agency conflicts contribute to the increase.},

In a recent series of simulation studies, however, several authors have questioned the correctness of QCA in this connection. Some prominent representatives of the method have replied in turn that simulations with artificial data are unsuited for assessing QCA. We take issue with either position in this impasse. On the one hand, we argue that data-driven evaluations of the correctness of a procedure of causal inference require artificial data. On the other hand, we prove all previous attempts in this direction to have been defective. For the first time in the literature on configurational comparative methods, we lay out a set of formal criteria for an adequate evaluation of QCA before implementing a battery of inverse-search trials to test how this method performs in different recovery contexts according to these criteria. While our results indicate that QCA is correct when generating the parsimonious solution type, they also demonstrate that the method is incorrect when generating the conservative and intermediate solution type. In consequence, researchers using QCA for causal inference, particularly in human-sensitive areas such as public health and medicine, should immediately discontinue employing the method's conservative and intermediate search strategies.},

Most of the literature on financialization is focused on the economies of the centre.

The theory of regulation permits analysis of different forms of financialization and the social dynamics linked with them. In contrast to Keynesian approaches, the state, international organizations and social forces shaping norms and policies are an explicit part of the theory. This allows for looking at policy-making within the analysis. Such an analysis enables us to explain policy changes (or lack of them) that are crucial for the processes of financialization and de-financialization in the periphery.},

After a brief introduction to QCA, the specific type of causality handled by QCA is discussed. QCA is shown to offer improvements over Mill's methods by handling asymmetric and multiple-conjunctural causality in addition to counterfactual reasoning. It thereby allows the explicitly separate analysis of necessity and sufficiency, recognizing the relevance of causal packages as well as single causes and of multiple causal paths leading to the same outcome (equifinality). It is argued that QCA can generalize findings to a small, medium and large number of cases.},

In the decades before the financial crisis, coordinated market economies (CMEs) and liberal market economies (LMEs) developed different but unsustainable growth models which resulted in global current account imbalances. We analyse the relative importance of wage coordination and income distribution in explaining the emergence of global imbalances. We argue that strongly rising top income shares contributed to the decline in household saving and current account imbalances in major LMEs, whereas pronounced falls in the wage share contributed to the weakness of domestic demand and rising current account balances in CMEs. Wage coordination affected current account imbalances both directly and, more importantly, indirectly through its effects on income distribution. We test the argument for a sample of 18 industrialized countries over the period 1981-2007.},

We analyze the relationship between the personal and the functional income distribution in our sample, before disentangling their effects on the current account. A consistent finding is that rising (top-end) personal inequality leads to a decrease of the current account, controlling for standard current account determinants. By contrast, a fall in the share of wages in national income leads to an increase in the current account. We further analyze how different measures of income distribution affect the financial balances of the household, corporate and government sectors and discuss potential theoretical explanations of our findings. We conclude that changes in personal and functional income distribution have contributed considerably to the widening of current account balances, and hence to the instability of the international economic system, prior to the global financial crisis starting in 2007.},

We use our DSGE set-up to study the impact of variations in house price expectations upon macroeconomic dynamics and their implications for monetary and macroprudential policies. Model simulations show that an increase in expected future house prices leads to a decline in mortgage defaults and interest rates on loans, whereas it leads to an increase in house prices, household debt, bank leverage ratios and economic activity. Interestingly, a positive fundamental housing preference shock causes a rise in inflation, whilst a positive non-fundamental shock to house prices generates a decline in inflation. We demonstrate that even though monetary policy reacting to household credit growth improves the stability of the real economy, yet it jeopardizes price stability. Finally, we show that the effectiveness of monetary versus macroprudential policy depends on whether the economy is affected by non-fundamental or fundamental shocks.},

  abstract = {We develop a three-country, stock- ow consistent macroeconomic model to study the e ects of changes in both personal and functional income distribution on national current account balances. Each country has a household sector and a non-household (corporate) sector. The household sector is divided into income deciles, and consumer demand is characterized by upward-looking status comparisons following the relative income hypothesis of consumption. The strength of consumption emulation depends on country-speci c institutions. The model is calibrated for the United States, Germany and China. Simulations suggest that a substantial part of the increase in household debt and the decrease in the current account in the United States since the early 1980s can be explained by the interplay of rising (top-end) household income inequality and institutions.

His definition is applied to two opposing theories in the history of monetary debates, and it is shown that the Chartalists (as opposed to the Metallists) developed a general theory of money that can be applied equally convincingly to the entire era of state money. This theory is then used to show that the state's power to make and enforce tax laws renders its money the most acceptable form of debt within what can be considered a `hierarchy' of monies. This leads to some important policy implications as well as a strengthening of the endogenous money position.},

Compared to the classical labor market Phillips curve the housing Phillips curve displays a reversed causality, from price changes to the unsold rate. We propose a consistent model based on microfoundations in which households decide on the sequence of buying and selling, i.e. whether to hold two or zero houses in the transition period. Data on individual sellers and buyers support the hypothesis that the propensity to hold two houses is pro-cyclical.},

This reform followed the failure of more than 2,000 depository institutions in the 1980s. Many failed because the incentive incompatibility of the structure of federal government-provided deposit insurance encouraged moral hazard behavior by banks and poor agent behavior by regulators. Insurance was put on a more incentive compatible basis, providing for a graduated series of sanctions mimicking market discipline that first may and then must be applied by the regulators on floundering banks. This article reviews these changes and evaluates early results.},

  abstract = {In this paper Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) is used to explore the extent to which states have taken distinct causal paths to higher levels of earnings inequality within the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and during the early years of the 2007\textendash 09 recession. In these analyses special attention is paid to both the regional unfolding of the processes constituting economic restructuring and whether state institutional arrangements appear to mediate the impacts of inequality-increasing developments. Overall, these analyses suggest that industry and occupational shifts are critical to understanding state and regional experiences; state variation in changes in earnings inequality are, in large part, a story of the continuous playing out of economic restructuring in unique ways in different areas of the country. However, the subnational impact of the growth or decline of particular types of occupations on the earnings distribution is found to be highly contingent, depending on both the types of jobs gained or lost and the institutional and economic context in which those developments occur. It is suggested that the overall contribution of industry shifts to rising inequality may be underemphasized, in part, as a result of a reliance on analytical approaches that are ill-suited to capture the complicated and contingent nature of the impacts of processes such as deindustrialization. These analyses contribute to a growing body of work that employs a distinctly sociological approach in which earnings determination is viewed as multi-level phenomenon. Building on this insight, this paper suggests that changes in subnational levels of inequality may also be usefully conceptualized as an inherently combinatorial phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Recent empirical work shows large consumption responses to house price movements. This is at odds with a prominent theoretical view which, using the logic of the permanent income hypothesis, argues that consumption responses should be small. We show that, in contrast to this view, workhorse models of consumption with incomplete markets calibrated to rich cross-sectional micro facts actually predict large consumption responses, in line with the data. To explain this result, we show that consumption responses to permanent house price shocks can be approximated by a simple and robust rule-of-thumb formula: the marginal propensity to consume out of temporary income times the value of housing. In our model, consumption responses depend on a number of factors such as the level and distribution of debt, the size and history of house price shocks, and the level of credit supply. Each of these effects is naturally explained with our simple formula.},

It has also generated a cottage industry of applied research and strong policy statements. This paper discusses the implications, in particular for developing and transition countries, from this literature. Our general conclusion is that its focus on the plight of small investors is too narrow when applied to these countries. We argue that this group is unlikely to play an important role in most developing and transition countries. External investors may still be crucial, particularly in transition countries, but they are more likely to come in as strategic investors or creditors. The paper also proposes a broader paradigm including other stakeholders and mechanisms of governance in order to better understand the problems facing these countries and generate policy implications that compensate for the weaknesses of capital markets.},

We also distinguish between growth effects of stocks and flows of credit. We find positive growth effects for credit flows to nonfinancial business but not for mortgage and other asset market credit flows. By accounting for the composition of credit stocks and for the effect of credit flows, we explain the insignificant or negative growth effects of financial development in recent times. What was true in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s when the field of empirical credit-growth studies blossomed, is no longer true in the 1990s and 2000s. New bank lending is not primarily to nonfinancial business and financial development may no longer be good for growth. These trends predate the 2008 crisis. They prompt a rethink of the role of banks in the process of economic growth. (JEL E44, O16, O40, C33)},

Some authors have extended the analysis to incorporate long-run net capital flows. We provide a critical evaluation of these efforts and propose an alternative approach to deal with long-run external debt sustainability, based on two key features. First, we treat the external debt-to-exports ratio as the relevant indicator for the analysis of external debt sustainability. Second, we include an external credit constraint in the form of a maximum acceptable level of this ratio. The main results that emerge are that sustainable long-run capital flows can positively affect the long-run level of output, but not the rate of growth compatible with the balance-of-payments constraint, as exports must ultimately tend to grow at the same rate as imports. Therefore, Thirlwall's law still holds.},

During the bust, a collapse in inflows keyed the debt decline, while an expansion of outflows due to defaults played a more minor role. Inflow declines partly reflect a dramatic falloff in first-time homebuying, especially for low credit score individuals.

  abstract = {From 1999 to 2013, U.S. mortgage debt doubled before contracting sharply. I estimate mortgage inflows and outflows that shed light on the sources of volatility. During the boom, inflows from real estate investors tripled, far outpacing other segments such as first-time homebuyers. During the bust, a collapse in inflows keyed the debt decline, while an expansion of outflows due to defaults played a more minor role. Inflow declines partly reflect a dramatic falloff in first-time homebuying, especially for low credit score individuals. Further analysis helps support the notion that the differential decline by credit score reflects markedly tightened credit supply.},

We estimate a 27 percent rise in extraction in response to a 100 basis point rate decline, and that house price growth amplifies this relationship. Differential responses to interest rates and home price appreciation by borrower age and credit score provide new evidence of financial frictions. Finally, equity extractions are associated with higher default risk, consistent with the use of borrowed funds for consumption or illiquid investment.},

The sections of the text are dedicated to discuss: the historical background; the transformations and the positive numbers during Lula's mandate (2003-2010); the worse performance and major challenges faced by Dilma's government (since 2011) and, finally, some ideas and priorities to renew and deepen this ``social-developmentalism''.},

(2005 Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 56, 489\textendash 512). The CATS model has been extensively used to replicate a large number of scaling types stylized facts with a remarkable degree of precision. For such purposes, the simulation of the model has been performed entering ad hoc parameter values and using the same initial set up for all the agents involved in the experiments. Nowadays alternative robust and reliable validation techniques for determining whether the simulation model is an acceptable representation of the real system are available. Moreover many distributional and goodness-of-fit tests have been developed while several graphical tools have been proposed to give the researcher a quick comprehension of actual and simulated data. This paper discusses some validation experiments performed with the modified CATS model. In particular starting from a sample of Italian firms included in the CEBI database, we perform several ex-post validation experiments over the simulation period 1982\textendash 2000. In the experiments, the model parameters have been estimated using actual data and the initial set up consists of a sample of agents in 1982. The CATS model is then simulated over the period 1982\textendash 2000. Using alternative validation techniques, the simulations' results are ex-post validated with respect to the actual data. The results are promising in that they show the good capabilities of the CATS model in reproducing the observed reality. Finally we have performed a first calibration experiment via indirect inference, in order to ameliorate our estimates. Even in this case, the results are interesting.},

The article stresses the relevance of putting into action two ``turbo-chargers'' of these three engines of investment; namely technological innovation and the recuperation of traditional productive chains.

We interpret the Covid-19 shock as a shock that reduces utility stemming from ``social'' goods in a two-sector economy with incomplete markets. We compare the advantages of lump-sum transfers versus a credit policy. For the same path of government debt, transfers are preferable when debt limits are tight, whereas credit policy is preferable when they are slack. A credit policy has the advantage of targeting fiscal resources toward agents that matter most for stabilizing demand. We illustrate this result with a calibrated model.

  abstract = {Comparative housing scholars have, for many years now, imported typologies from non-housing spheres to explain housing phenomena. Notably, approaches attempting to account for divergent housing tenure patterns and trends have frequently been organized around typologies based on the assumption that a causal relationship exists between homeownership rates and the type of welfare regime or, more recently, the variety of residential capitalism a country exhibits. While these housing-welfare regime approaches have provided important research tools, we argue that the typologies they generate represent cross-sectional snapshots which offer little enduring cogency. Based on long-run data, we show that the postulated associations between homeownership, welfare and mortgage debt are historically contingent. This paper makes the case for employing historicized typologies, proposing a country-based typology linking historical housing finance system trajectories to urban form and tenure, with regional dimensions. We argue the need for typologies which can accommodate longitudinal, path-dependent dimensions, both within and between countries.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we argue that the complexion of housing finance systems in OECD countries, both now and historically, has a significant bearing on a number of core housing-related indicators, including housing form, tenure composition, and urban development. Existing literature in the fields of housing studies and comparative political economy, however, has often neglected the historical dynamics of housing finance, while contemporaneously, financial historians have focused almost exclusively on company and not mortgage finance. We identify four different "ideal types" of housing finance systems that developed in mature capitalist economies when organized housing finance institutions began to emerge throughout the long nineteenth century: informal person-to-person lending and state lending as solutions outside specialized banking circuits, and deposit-based and bond-based institutions as banking solutions. We adapt Alexander Gerschenkron's theory of economic backwardness in order to explain the temporal-spatial emergence of these distinct types. We draw a path-dependent conclusion, noting that the more countries developed bond-based mortgage banks in the nineteenth century, the more they tended towards multi-story building structure, low homeownership rates and lower securitization levels in the twentieth century. A collection of unique historical city and country data supports these findings.},

This paper reviews the theoretical arguments and examines the empirical evidence, constructing and using a new US time series of data on the q ratio from 1900 to 1988. We decompose q - - the ratio of the market value of corporate capital to its replacement cost - - into the product of two terms, reflecting "fundamentals" and "valuation", the ratio of market value to fundamentals. We then examine the relation of investment to each of the two, using a number of alternative proxies for fundamentals. We interpret our results as pointing, strongly but not overwhelmingly, to a larger role of "fundamentals" than of "valuation" in investment decisions.},

The possibility is considered that the crisis of the 1960s was more of a market correction after the bull run of the 1950s. The fall of the stock prices is an adjustment to the abrupt halt of the growth of dividends, the potential impacts of internal political choices and of the structural characteristics of the French stock market during this period are also investigated.},

Wage increases cause a loss of competitiveness that reduces the trade balance. If the economy is relatively open to trade and price elasticities satisfy certain restrictions, the worsening of the trade balance more than outweighs the increase in workers' consumption, thus reducing the growth rate. The main theoretical innovation is a flexible markup pricing rule that allows changes in unit labor costs and exchange rates to affect profit margins. Implications for international relations and class conflict are discussed. Copyright 1989 by Oxford University Press.},

We compute these imbalances as the difference between asset prices and a benchmark value that we approximate with fundamentals in a discounted cash-flow model, the fitted value of asset prices in a data-driven model or the trend in a standard trend/cycle filtering model. We find that ECB monetary policy has affected both stock and house prices in the euro area since 2008. However, we show that monetary policy influences stock price imbalances but not house price imbalances. Exploring further the mechanism, we find that this response of stock price imbalances is driven by central bank information shocks, not by pure policy shocks.},

  abstract = {Estimation of the dynamic error components model is considered using two alternative linear estimators that are designed to improve the properties of the standard first-differenced GMM estimator. Both estimators require restrictions on the initial conditions process. Asymptotic efficiency comparisons and Monte Carlo simulations for the simple AR(1) model demonstrate the dramatic improvement in performance of the proposed estimators compared to the usual first-differenced GMM estimator, and compared to non-linear GMM. The importance of these results is illustrated in an application to the estimation of a labour demand model using company panel data.},

  abstract = {Previous research on dynamic panel estimation has focused on panels that, unlike a typical panel of macroeconomic data, have small time dimensions and large individual dimensions. We use a Monte Carlo approach to investigate the performance of several different methods designed to reduce the bias of the estimated coefficients for the longer, narrower panels commonly found for macro data. We find that the bias of the least squares dummy variable approach can be significant, even when the time dimension of the panel is as large as 30. For panels with small time dimensions, we find a corrected least squares dummy variable estimator to be the best choice. However, as the time dimension of the panel increases, the computationally simpler Anderson-Hsiao estimator performs equally well. We apply our recommendations to a panel of countries to show that increases in income growth precede increases in savings rates and increases in savings rates precede declines in income growth.},

Using a unique intraday dataset, we show that US macroeconomic news releases have large and significant effects on global risky asset prices. Stock price indexes of 27 countries, commodity prices, and the VIX all jump instantaneously upon news releases. The responses of stock indexes co-move across countries and are large\textemdash often comparable in size to the response of the S\&P 500. Further, these effects are persistent. US macroeconomic news explain up to 22\% of the quarterly variation in foreign stock markets. The joint behavior of stock prices and long-term bond yields suggests that systematic monetary policy responses to news play a limited role for explaining the behavior of international stock markets. Instead, the evidence is consistent with a direct effect on investors' risk-taking capacity. Overall, our findings show that a byproduct of the United States' central position in the global financial system is that news about its business cycle have large effects on global financial conditions.},

On two other dimensions, the model's business cycle implications are actually improved. Its enhanced internal propagation allows it to account for the fact that there is positive persistence in output growth, and the model also provides a resolution to the 'excess sensitivity puzzle' for consumption and income. Key features of the model are habit persistence preferences, and a multisector technology with limited intersectoral mobility of factors of production.},

The empirical results indicate the yield spread is a statistically and economically significant predictor of real economic activity in several industrial countries besides the United States.

  abstract = {Over the recent months, several initiatives have taken place to develop macro-prudential regulation in order to prevent systemic risk and the build-up of financial imbalances. These discussions took place in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis that is the consequence of the bust of an house price bubble that took place in the US and spread out to most developed countries. Crucial to the success of such policy is the ability of the macro-prudential authority to identify in due time such imbalances, generally featured by asset price boom-bust cycles. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of detecting house price booms according to alternative identification strategies and assess their robustness. In addition, we try to disentangle costless or low-cost from costly house price booms. Resorting both to a non-parametric approach and a discrete-choice (logit) model, we analyze the ability of a set of indicators to robustly explain costly house price booms. According to our results, real long term interest rates, total investment, real credit and real stock prices tend to increase the probability of a costly house price boom.},

While identifying financial imbalances ex ante can be difficult, this paper presents empirical evidence that it is not impossible. In particular, sustained rapid credit growth combined with large increases in asset prices appears to increase the probability of an episode of financial instability. The paper also argues that while low and stable inflation promotes financial stability, it also increases the likelihood that excess demand pressures show up first in credit aggregates and asset prices, rather than in goods and services prices. Accordingly, in some situations, a monetary response to credit and asset markets may be appropriate to preserve both financial and monetary stability.},

  abstract = {In analysing the performance of the international monetary and financial system (IMFS), too much attention has been paid to the current account and far too little to the capital account. This is true of both formal analytical models and historical narratives. This approach may be reasonable when financial markets are highly segmented. But it is badly inadequate when they are closely integrated, as they have been most of the time since at least the second half of the 19th century. Zeroing on the capital account shifts the focus from the goods markets to asset markets and balance sheets. Seen through this lens, the IMFS looks quite different. Its main weakness is its propensity to amplify financial surges and collapses that generate costly financial crises \textendash{} its ``excess financial elasticity''. And assessing the vulnerabilities it hides requires going beyond the residence/non-resident distinction that underpins the balance of payments to look at the consolidated balance sheets of the decision units that straddle national borders, be these banks or non-financial companies. We illustrate these points by revisiting two defining historical phases in which financial meltdowns figured prominently, the interwar years and the more recent Great Financial Crisis.},

After briefly reviewing the content of Pasinetti's volume, the author presents a general consideration on the method employed. The relationship between Pasinetti's approach to the analysis of economic growth and structural change on the one hand, and neoclassical theory, on the other, is then briefly considered. Finally, the model of a `pure labour' economy is assessed, and the procedure of abstraction to be used in investigating structural dynamics is discussed. In particular, it is argued that Pasinetti's method is based upon a realist approach, and that attention is focused upon general principles rather than empirical regularities derived from observation. In this connection, Smith's and Ricardo's treatments of a `pure labour' economy are considered, and it is argued that they are based upon alternative simplifying assumptions: exclusion of capital goods in Smith's case, uniform ratios of capital to labour in Ricardo's case. The author maintains that a Ricardian-type pure labour economy may enhance the plausibility of Pasinetti's approach to structural dynamics, and facilitate possible extensions.},

  abstract = {Monetary circuit theory is one of the most interesting attempts to formally describe the functioning of a monetary production economy as centered around the concept of flux-reflux of money. Endogenous money creation by commercial banks allows the circuit to open and firms to implement production processes. Financial markets ``passively'' close the circuit by intermediating savings via bond and equity issuance. Despite its natural focus on financial-real side links, the monetary circuit literature has paid relatively little attention to `financialization' and the way it has modified real-financial dynamics. In this paper, we analyze whether the flux-reflux perspective of the circuit may be fruitfully applied to the description of the linkages between the real economy and finance in a financialized economy. We propose two interconnected circuits, one for the real economy and one for the financial one. In this context, finance can still ensure a consistent closure of the whole system, thus directly allowing the functioning of the real economy. Newly developed inside-finance interactions, however, may indirectly influence real world dynamics by easing/restricting access to credit/financial markets and give rise to boom-and-bust cycles. Our aim is twofold: modeling modern financial worlds within a MC framework and understanding how financialization could have changed real-financial interactions.},

  abstract = {We propose a simple short-run Post-Keynesian model in which the key aspects of shadow banking, namely securitization and the production of structured finance instruments, are explicitly formalized. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to broaden purely real-side Post-Keynesian models and their traditional focus on shareholder-value orientation, the financialization of non-financial firms, and the profit-led vs. wage-led dichotomy. We rather put emphasis on the role of financial institutions and rentier-friendly environment in determining the predominance of specific growth and distribution regimes. First, we illustrate the macroeconomic rationale of shadow banking practices. We show how, before the 2007\textendash 08 crisis, securitization and shadow banking allowed for an increase in profitability for the whole financial sector, while apparently keeping leverage under control. Second, we define a variety of shadow-banking-led regimes in terms of economic activity, productive capital accumulation, and income distribution.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, complexity economics has emerged as a powerful approach to the understanding of the most relevant factors influencing economic development. The concept of economic complexity has been applied to the study of different economic issues such as economic growth, technological change and inequality. With this work we aim at extending the application of this concept to the study of the financial side of the economy, and, in particular, of the macroeconomic effects of rising financial complexity. In this paper, we present an agent-based model integrating an increasingly complex financial sector with a real side of the economy populated, among other sectors, by heterogeneous households. We test the systemic impact that the increasing complexity of both the financial system and the financial products it manufactures bear on economic growth, macroeconomic stability and inequality. We find mixed results with respect to the positive economic implications the existing literature ascribes to products complexity and deepening production capabilities. Despite higher financial complexity may lead to faster growth, our model suggests that this comes at the cost of heightened financial fragility, a more crisis-prone economic system, and increasing levels of income and wealth inequality. According to these findings, and consistently with pioneering insights from Minsky, we claim that rising complexity does not always entail positive consequences for the well-being of the economy. This is particularly true when it comes to financial innovations and financial complexity.},

Using a Stock-Flow Consistent approach based on the Lotka\textendash Volterra logic, we couple its nonlinear monetary dynamics of underemployment and income distribution with abatement costs. A calibration of our model at the scale of the world economy enables us to simulate various planetary scenarios. Our findings are threefold: 1) the +2 \textdegree C target is already out of reach, absent negative emissions; 2) the longterm (resp. short-term) results of climate change on economic fundamentals may lead to severe economic consequences without the implementation (resp. in case of too rapid an application) of proactive climate policies. Global warming (resp. too fast transition) forces the private sector to leverage in order to compensate for output and capital losses (resp. to lower carbon emissions), thus endangering financial stability; 3) Implementing an adequate carbon price trajectory, as well as increasing the wage share, fostering employment, and reducing private debt make it easier to avoid unintended degrowth and to reach a +2.5 \textdegree C target.},

However, social democratic countries develop a cooperative approach to the knowledge-based economy: rather homogeneous educational level, lifelong learning, negotiation by social partners of the consequence of innovation and collectively organized labour mobility. There is a third configuration for some catching-up economies that use information technology as a method of leapfrogging: labour markets remain largely institutionalized and regulated, without exerting adverse impact upon macroeconomic performance.},

Parte-se da hip\'otese de que o processo de financeiriza\c{c}\~ao, ocorrido em n\'ivel mundial, expressa-se no Brasil com especificidades e incompletudes, ainda que alinhado ao de outros pa\'ises, tendo relev\^ancia crescente na pol\'itica social, na qual o sistema de educa\c{c}\~ao superior se destaca como elemento representativo. Assim, \'e inicialmente realizada uma conceitua\c{c}\~ao geral do fen\^omeno por meio de sentidos espec\'ificos, posicionando a quest\~ao abordada. Ap\'os isso, investiga-se suas origens no Brasil e a forma pela qual esse atualmente se manifesta. Por fim, utilizam-se os sentidos previamente definidos para apontar a financeiriza\c{c}\~ao ocorrida na educa\c{c}\~ao superior privada em per\'iodos recentes. Essa \'e apresentada por duas \'oticas: de um lado, um maior endividamento das fam\'ilias atrav\'es de um cr\'edito educacional subsidiado pelo governo, e, de outro, grandes conglomerados educacionais com atitudes de mercado altamente agressivas, em busca de uma valoriza\c{c}\~ao acion\'aria r\'apida e constante. O papel do Estado \'e visto como fundamental nesse processo, tanto atrav\'es de um custoso sistema de cr\'edito educacional (FIES), quanto de um subs\'idio direto e expressivo \`as empresas educacionais (PROUNI). O que se encontra \'e um crescente n\'umero de alunos beneficiados e progressivamente endividados, anexo a uma forte mudan\c{c}a nesse setor, com grande n\'umero de fus\~oes e aquisi\c{c}\~oes, acompanhada de uma concentra\c{c}\~ao de mercado pari passu a entrada dessas grandes corpora\c{c}\~oes no mercado acion\'ario, com valoriza\c{c}\~ao acelerada.

Beyond the display of the evolution of such models, the paper intends to demonstrate that the original kaldorian models have served as a solid foundation over which new formulations have been built, continually demonstrating the relevance of the author's ideas. The model's extensions, other than allowing for the incorporation of an increasing number of economic characteristics originally proposed by Kaldor, also have considerably increased the analytical scope of the field by establishing theoretical links with other schools of thought. A neo-schumpeterian view is possible via the introduction of the impacts of technological gaps and innovation into the models. In its turn, a structuralist perspective is obtained by decomposing trade elasticities. Finally, from kaleckian growth models, the importance of a multi-sectoral analysis and of distinct distributive regimes over economic growth is brought to the models.},

To understand these varieties using a quantitative economic approach, therefore, requires delving beneath the conventional aggregate economic indicators. This chapter takes a sectoral approach to economic growth, highlighting organisational and institutional differences, which underpin economic performance. Since institutions are slow to change, it is important to consider a long period, and we focus here on the period since 1870, for which reliable data are available. We consider Europe as a whole, which includes a number of countries that have remained relatively backwards as well as the key countries in the varieties of capitalism debate, and we also consider the US as the lead country during the twentieth century.},

  abstract = {Resumo: O modelo supermultiplicador (Serrano, 1995; Bortis, 1997) tem ganhado espa\c{c}o no debate p\'os-keynesiano. Na sua vers\~ao mais recente, o modelo combina o gasto aut\^onomo, que cresce a uma taxa dada exogenamente, com o comportamento harrodiano das firmas (Freitas, 2015; Allain, 2015; Lavoie, 2016). Isso permite que a capacidade se ajuste \`a demanda no longo prazo, com o grau de utiliza\c{c}\~ao retornando ao seu n\'ivel considerado normal. O pressuposto de que o crescimento do gasto aut\^onomo \'e ex\'ogeno exclui, quase que por defini\c{c}\~ao, a possibilidade de que altera\c{c}\~oes na distribui\c{c}\~ao de renda e nos gastos induzidos (nas propens\~oes a gastar) tenham efeitos permanentes de crescimento. Al\'em disso, tais modelos s\~ao, em sua maioria, modelos de fluxo que omitem os determinantes financeiros do gasto aut\^onomo e as implica\c{c}\~oes das intera\c{c}\~oes entre fluxos e estoques na economia. Levando isso em considera\c{c}\~ao, a tese se prop\~oe a avaliar os resultados do modelo supermultiplicador quando o pressuposto original - de que o crescimento do componente aut\^onomo de demanda \'e completamente ex\'ogeno - \'e relaxado. A tese ainda busca analisar as caracter\'isticas do modelo supermultiplicador quando estendido a uma estrutura financeira mais complexa, que considere n\~ao apenas os fluxos e o estoque de capital, mas tamb\'em os estoques financeiros. Adota-se para tal a metodologia Stock-Flow Consistent, que permite conciliar ambos objetivos. Procura-se mostrar que a endogeneiza\c{c}\~ao do gasto aut\^onomo altera alguns resultados de longo prazo do modelo original. Isso significa que, assim como nos modelos neo-kaleckianos, \'e poss\'ivel que, no modelo supermultiplicador, mudan\c{c}as na distribui\c{c}\~ao de renda, assim como a expans\~ao da demanda via propens\~oes a gastar, tenham efeitos permanentes de crescimento. Os efeitos de crescimento s\~ao ainda reavaliados em uma estrutura que incorpora (a) o conflito distributivo entre trabalhadores e capitalistas, o crescimento end\'ogeno da produtividade do trabalho e o emprego; (b) a intera\c{c}\~ao entre duas economias semelhantes sob diferentes regimes cambiais. No cap\'itulo dois, A Supermultiplier Stock-Flow Consistent model: the ''return'' of the paradoxes of thrift and costs in the long run?, o gasto aut\^onomo \'e endogeneizado (consumo a partir da riqueza) e os paradoxos da poupan\c{c}a e dos custos s\~ao avaliados no longo prazo. Os resultados das simula\c{c}\~oes num\'ericas indicam que o paradoxo da poupan\c{c}a permanece v\'alido e que uma parcela de lucros mais baixa pode estar associada a taxas mais elevadas de acumula\c{c}\~ao de capital, embora com taxas de lucro mais baixas. No cap\'itulo tr\^es, Conficting-claims and labour market concerns in a Supermultiplier model, o modelo do cap\'itulo dois \'e estendido para dar conta da din\^amica do mercado de trabalho. A infla\c{c}\~ao \'e incorporada no modelo via conflito distributivo entre trabalhadores e capitalistas e o crescimento end\'ogeno da produtividade do trabalho \'e introduzido, configurando a endogeneiza\c{c}\~ao da distribui\c{c}\~ao de renda. No cap\'itulo quatro, Growth and distribution in a Two-Country Supermultiplier Stock-Flow Consistent model, o modelo do cap\'itulo 1 \'e estendido para um sistema de dois pa\'ises com caracter\'isticas semelhantes. Os resultados das simula\c{c}\~oes num\'ericas indicam que tanto uma redu\c{c}\~ao no mark-up das firmas quanto o aumento na propens\~ao a consumir a partir da renda t\^em efeito positivo de crescimento sobre as duas economias em ambos os regimes de c\^ambio, fixo e flutuante. Al\'em disso, se a condi\c{c}\~ao de Marshall-Lerner for v\'alida, a economia que expande sua demanda dom\'estica ganha relativamente mais do que a economia parceira (aumenta a sua participa\c{c}\~ao no estoque de capital do sistema). O regime de c\^ambio ainda influencia, al\'em da distribui\c{c}\~ao de renda, a distribui\c{c}\~ao de riqueza entre as economias. Por fim, um est\'imulo coordenado \`a demanda faz ambas economias crescerem a uma taxa mais elevada em compara\c{c}\~ao a um choque isolado \`a demanda em uma das economias},

Though discussing autonomous consumption, most of the theoretical papers rely on private investment-led growth models. An alternative approach is the so-called Sraffian supermultipler model, which treats long-run investment as induced, allowing for the possibility that other final demand components \textendash{} including consumption \textendash{} may lead long-run growth. We suggest that the dialogue between these approaches is not only possible but may prove to be quite fruitful.},

The aim of this comparison is twofold: (i) to analyze under which conditions the paradox of debt emerges in the household and firms sector in each model; (ii) to evaluate the extent in which these conditions differ due to each models' specific closure. Preliminary results suggest that the paradox of debt in firms' sector is not a necessary result of supermultiplier models. As for households sector, the paradox of debt is a feature of the canonical supermultiplier model, yet there may be episodes of rising debt-to-income ratios and financial crisis as precipitated by policy decisions.},

Three linkages of financial engineering to effective demand are identified: (1) funding effects, (2) liquidity preference or speculative effects, and (3) balance sheet or Minsky effects. Data from the Survey of Consumer Finances are used to investigate the importance of asset-backed security-related funding and balance sheet (Minsky) effects in the United States. Evidence is shown that financial engineering has boosted borrowing power at all income levels. The liberal use of expanded borrowing opportunities has fueled the growth of consumption-especially since 1995. However, a secularly rising share of U.S. households have entered the categories of "speculative" or "Ponzi" finance units-a factor that raises doubts about the sustainability of the current spending boom.]},

The results show that facilitated access to capital makes investments in sustainable technologies more attractive for all firms, especially for small and medium enterprises. Without policy instruments such as carbon price, the decrease in emissions in the long-term is due to investments in natural gas-based technologies, as they typically have lower capital and operating costs, and also lower electricity consumption than coal-based production. Conversely, with policy instruments in place, a strong decrease in emissions occurs between 2060 and 2080 due to investors choosing natural gas and biomethane-based technologies, with carbon capture and storage. In the long term, natural gas and biomethane could compete, with the outcome depending on infrastructure, supply chain availability and land use constraints.},

This approach uses a new set of estimators known in the literature as the common correlated effect, which essentially consists of increasing the model to be fit by adding the averages of the individuals in each time t, of both the dependent variable and the specific regressors of each individual.

  abstract = {External constriction and economic growth: an open multisectoral simulation model This paper discusses the dynamics of economic growth in developing economies using the Keynesian and Kaleckian effective demand principle as well as the balance of payments constrained demand-led growth models, conceived by ECLAC (Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean) and developed by Thirlwall. To this effect, a computer simulation model was developed to capture the effects on the balance of payments and on economic growth rates under different growth patterns. The main conclusions drawn were: i) growth rates of an economy in which the dynamics are exclusively driven by internal conditions will, from a certain point, be constrained by the rise in external vulnerability; ii) if productive sectors are able to introduce innovative dynamics increasing the competitiveness of their products and therefore the export coefficients, economic growth will be driven by internal demand, postponing, although not precluding, the risk of foreign vulnerability.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the restructuring of the Spanish financial system. This study is justified by the massive economic and social impact of this process in Spain. Based on the annual accounts and the annual reports of Spanish credit institutions, a model was created to predict the possibility of bank failure or bailout. The variables were selected following a review of the literature. They included the legal form of the credit institution (savings bank versus bank), leverage, real estate investment, gross operating margin, staff costs and non-performing loans. Two variables that had not previously been used in studies of this type were also included in the model: risk-weighted assets and coverage (as part of the provisions for non-performing loans). Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was used for the analysis. Use of fsQCA is another novel aspect of this study. This technique has never been used to predict corporate bankruptcy or the failure of credit institutions. Proposals were made and tested using data on Spanish banks and savings banks for the year 2010, a critical year for the Spanish financial system. The results yield several interesting conclusions. First, greater leverage increases the probability of survival, contrary to the opinion of most scholars. This result shows that the problem facing Spanish credit institutions was the closure of international markets, not the level of debt. Another key conclusion is that financial institutions with higher staff costs have a greater chance of survival. Therefore, the widespread policy of reducing human resource costs should be reconsidered. Finally, the risk-weighted assets measure offers an excellent predictor of failure of credit institutions, as well as providing other benefits, which substantially increase the value of this measure.},

The exact magnitude of this shock to the world economy is uncertain, but many believe that the setback in GDP will be on a scale similar to, if not worse than, the first years of the Great Recession. As such, there is an imperative need for policy actions of a Keynesian nature, as have already been implemented in many countries. In the present paper, with Denmark as a case study, using an SFC modelling approach, some aspects of the negative economic impact of the COVID-19 virus on the Danish economy are highlighted, as are the consequences of the policy actions adopted by the Danish Parliament.},

Desta vez, os efeitos foram suficientemente graves para que a crise fosse comparada \`a de 1929. Por seus impactos negativos sobre o ritmo de crescimento econ\^omico, nos Estados Unidos e no mundo \textquestiondown{} que at\'e 2017 n\~ao havia retomado os patamares anteriores \`a crise \textquestiondown{} e pelo acirramento de conflitos sociais que se seguiu, a crise das hipotecas subprime parece ter explicitado as contradi\c{c}\~oes da configura\c{c}\~ao contempor\^anea do capitalismo americano, em que as finan\c{c}as s\~ao capazes de impor sua l\'ogica e seus condicionantes ao processo de acumula\c{c}\~ao, dando origem a um regime de acumula\c{c}\~ao financeirizado. Se os im\'oveis residenciais e seus v\'inculos com os mercados financeiros estiveram no epicentro da mais grave crise do regime financeirizado, encontravam-se igualmente presentes na fase anterior de ascens\~ao do ciclo, mesmo antes de 2002, quando a acelera\c{c}\~ao do processo de valoriza\c{c}\~ao das resid\^encias americanas, apoiada na pol\'itica de baixas taxa de juros do Federal Reserve, liderou a recupera\c{c}\~ao econ\^omica dos EUA, compensando os efeitos negativos da desvaloriza\c{c}\~ao dos mercados acion\'arios. O objetivo dessa tese \'e, \`a luz dos eventos revelados pela crise subprime, identificar as transforma\c{c}\~oes institucionais que possibilitaram que os im\'oveis residenciais desempenhassem um papel central no regime de acumula\c{c}\~ao financeirizado dos EUA, tanto nas fases de crescimento econ\^omico como na crise que se seguiu. Em outros termos, busca-se mostrar que novas formas de financiar, gerir e construir esses ativos imobili\'arios tamb\'em integraram as transforma\c{c}\~oes ocorridas, a partir dos anos 1970 e 1980, que deram os contornos da configura\c{c}\~ao atual do capitalismo americano},

  abstract = {The global financial crisis has forced standard macroeconomics to re-examine the plausibility of its assumptions and the adequacy of the policy prescriptions flowing from those assumptions. We believe a renewal of macroeconomic thinking and macroeconomic modeling is possible by recognizing that our economies should be analyzed as complex adaptive systems. A coherent and exhaustive representation of the inter-linkages between the real and financial sides of the economy is vital as well. We propose a macroeconomic framework based on a novel combination of the Agent Based and Stock Flow Consistent approaches. This paper presents a benchmark model for this innovative approach. Our model depicts an economy with capital and credit in which different types of agents locally interact on different markets. We provide a detailed representation of individual agents' balance sheets, ensuring the model accounting consistency at the micro, meso, and macro levels. We analyze the properties of our simulated economy under different configurations of agent heuristics, focusing in particular on the role of credit and investment. We explain in detail the logic followed to calibrate and validate the model. Results show that our benchmark model is able to reproduce many stylized facts observed in real world, thus representing a good starting point to test -- in the next works -- different economic policies and institutional setups. Finally, the relatively simple and flexible structure of the model opens up many possibilities for development of the framework along different lines, thus providing a fertile soil for new applications.},

  abstract = {We argue that a fundamental difference between the various post-Keynesian approaches to economic growth lies in their treatment of investment. Neo-Kaleckian models, which are more appropriately Robinsonian models, postulate an investment function dependent on profitability, and that is partly autonomous from income. Some of these models rely on the importance of profitability, captured by the profit share, to make the case for profit-led growth. For their part, Kaldorian models, which are in our view compatible with Sraffian models, place the emphasis on the accelerator in the determination of investment. More importantly, since investment is a derived demand, that is, ruled by the adjustment of capacity to autonomous demand, there is a tendency to a normal level of capacity utilization. These are supermultiplier models. In our view the Kaldorian approach is better equipped to deal with some of the issues relating income distribution to accumulation with effective demand in an open economy in the long run. We develop an open economy model to examine the conditions under which an increase in real wages can produce wage-led growth, showing that the limit to wage-led expansion is a binding external constraint. The model is unique in emphasizing the role of income distribution in affecting real exchange rates, and it is through this channel that the ambiguous effects of income distribution on growth arise. We also provide some evidence indicating that real wages are positively related to growth, investment, and capacity utilization, and we highlight the role of finance in sustaining expansions suggesting that debt-led growth should not be identified with profit-led growth.},

We develop new tests which enable us to isolate the sign and direction of long-run effects in a manner that is robust to the presence of unknown heterogeneous short-run causal relationships. We show that while infrastructure does tend to cause long-run economic growth, there is substantial variation across countries. We also provide evidence that each infrastructure type is provided at close to the growth-maximizing level on average globally, but is under-supplied in some countries and over-supplied in others.},

The paper also tries to identify macroeconomic variables which could be associated with sovereign risk ratings awarded by rating agencies to each country. After examining the indicators on an individual basis, their potential as a group is tested econometrically as a determinant of the class of sovereign risk into which national economies fall. Our results constitute a set of indicators which emerging economies would be well advised to improve upon.},

The stabilizing e on output is only roughly 30 percent for a bubble shock compared to a capital quality shock. Further, while credit policy increases the recovery speed for a capital quality shock it does not a the recovery speed after a bursting bubble.

By means of an agent-based model, we replicate an artificial creditnetwork economy in order to assess the impact of growing income inequality in the presence of peer effects and home equity borrowing. We show that the resulting debt-financed consumption boom jeopardises the stability of the economic system, thus paving the way for a financial crisis. Our model includes a behavioural rule for consumption based on expenditure cascades, a hierarchical structure of household finance, an articulated credit market with collateralised consumption loans and mortgages and a simple housing market. Results show that the model is able to capture the economic and social pressure of inequality on low and middle income households that pushes them to increase their consumption via home equity extraction. Rising non-performing loans lead to higher bad debt on the banks' balance sheets and, consequently, to the emergence of a crisis as an endogenous dynamic.},

No plano estrutural, desde os anos 1990, ocorre a crescente integra\c{c}\~ao da economia brasileira a uma economia financeirizada nos pa\'ises desenvolvidos, marcada por recorrentes bolhas de pre\c{c}os de ativos e por uma crise financeira de grandes propor\c{c}\~oes em 2008. Medidas de pol\'itica econ\^omica para lidar com essa crise, nos pa\'ises centrais, fundadas na pol\'itica monet\'aria n\~ao convencional, exacerbaram os ciclos de liquidez, subjacentes \`as bolhas. No \^ambito produtivo, observou-se a constitui\c{c}\~ao de cadeias globais de valor com a fragmenta\c{c}\~ao das etapas produtivas, originando uma intensifica\c{c}\~ao da concorr\^encia fundada na redu\c{c}\~ao de pre\c{c}os, acentuada ap\'os a crise em raz\~ao do aparecimento de capaci-dade ociosa generalizada, mormente na China. No plano dom\'estico, a economia brasileira assistiu no per\'iodo 2003/2010 a uma acelera\c{c}\~ao do crescimento impulsionado, inicialmente, pelos pre\c{c}os das commodities e, posteriormente, pelo r\'apido crescimento do consumo, e por fim, mas n\~ao por \'ultimo, pelo investimento, induzido por ambos. Esse ciclo, embora peculiar por se acompanhar da melhoria da distribui\c{c}\~ao da renda, perdeu pro-gressivamente dinamismo. Em parte, pela perda de velocidade da melhoria da distribui\c{c}\~ao fundada em mecanismos salariais, mas principalmente pelos limites ao endividamento das fam\'ilias. Ademais, os programas p\'ublicos de transfer\^encia de renda, muito relevantes para explicar a melhoria da distribui\c{c}\~ao, alcan\c{c}aram um limite no quadro fiscal prevalecente. O investimento, por sua vez, teve seu dinamismo atenuado pelo vazamento de parte da demanda de m\'aquinas e equi-pamentos e insumos intermedi\'arios para o exterior, em raz\~ao da especializa\c{c}\~ao regressiva. O arrefecimento do ciclo de 2003/2010 impunha a busca de um novo modelo de crescimento. Para tanto, a escolha recaiu na diversifica\c{c}\~ao da estrutu-ra produtiva, para suplantar a especializa\c{c}\~ao regressiva, e na amplia\c{c}\~ao da infra-estrutura, em parte sobreutilizada, em parte sucateada, por anos de baixo inves-timento.

The distinctive feature is in that the aggregation of heterogeneous agents is not performed numerically as in traditional agent-based models, but by means of an innovative analytical methodology, originally developed in statistical mechanics and recently imported into macroeconomics. Numerical and analytical results reveal that while boosting aggregate demand, a raise in the minimum wage and a reduction in wage inequality can also lead the economy toward more sustainable paths in both household debt and the degree of 'financialisation'. These results are shown to be the exact opposite to the observed responses of the economy to a raise in the interest rate charged on bank loans.},

After presenting empirical evidence for the US economy that the propensity to save increases significantly from the bottom to the top quintile of wage earners, we demonstrate that more equal distributions always lead to higher output in the traditional neo-Kaleckian macroeconomic model. We also present conditions under which a reduction of income inequality among workers turns demand more wage-led. This view is supported by the results of an econometric study for the United States (1967-2010) which show that the rise after 1980 in income inequality has made the US economy more profit-led.},

After presenting empirical evidence for the US economy that the propensity to save increases significantly from the bottom to the top quintile of wage earners, we demonstrate that more equal distributions always lead to higher output in the traditional neo-Kaleckian macroeconomic model. We also present conditions under which a reduction of income inequality among workers results in demand becoming more wage led. This view is supported by the results of an econometric study for the USA (1967\textendash 2010), which show that the rise after 1980 in income inequality has made the US economy more profit led.},

The chapter describes the traditional process of disequilibrium adjustment which is unique to the housing market, and which has played itself out during every previous recovery period. It presents a perspective that helps integrate the effects of the important, but seemingly disparate, aspects of the current housing crisis in the USA. These aspects include home price changes, expectations about price changes, the demand for housing, and the diffusion of relaxed mortgage underwriting standards in the USA during the period leading up to the crash in the housing market.

Relying on a mixed-methods research strategy that combines econometric and qualitative comparative analysis, it proceeds through three consecutive steps. First, there is a discussion of how democratic institutions may solicit governments' attention toward social issues. Second, the relationship between democratisation and human development in 21 post-communist countries is tested. Third, democracy in its core attributes is unpacked, and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) is used to identify a few alternative institutional configurations favouring human development. The analysis reveals that not only full democracies, but also some hybrid regimes, have been successful in this task.},

Despite the potential epistemological links between `cases' and `agents,' neither camp has leveraged their combined strengths. A bridge can be built, however, by drawing on Abbott's insight that `agents are cases doing things', Byrne's suggestion that `cases are complex systems with agency', and by viewing CBM and ABM within the broader trend towards computational modelling of cases. To demonstrate the utility of this bridge, we describe how CBM can utilise ABM to identify case-based trends; explore the interactions and collective behaviour of cases; and study different scenarios. We also describe how ABM can utilise CBM to identify agent types; construct agent behaviour rules; and link these to outcomes to calibrate and validate model results. To further demonstrate the bridge, we review a public health study that made initial steps in combining CBM and ABM.},

  abstract = {This paper delivers new evidence on the individual and policy drivers of residential mobility, covering a wide range of housing-related policies and conditions but also other relevant policy areas. The analysis uses household-level micro datasets allowing for an investigation of the drivers of the decision to move for a large number of OECD countries; as well for identifying differential policy effects across socio-economic groups, underscoring the distributional effect of policies. The evidence strongly supports the view that housing conditions and structural policies influence people's decisions and possibilities to move. A more responsive housing supply is associated with higher residential mobility, suggesting that reforming land-use and planning policies may facilitate moving by reducing house price differences across locations. Social cash and in-kind spending on housing are positively correlated with residential mobility. Higher housing transaction costs, including from transfer taxes, are associated with lower residential mobility, especially among younger households, which are more likely to be first time-buyers. Stricter rental regulations are associated with lower residential mobility, particularly for renters, low-educated and low-income households. Beyond housing policies, more generous cash income support to low-wage jobseekers and minimum income schemes embedded in social transfers are positively associated with residential mobility; while excessive job protection on regular contracts is negatively associated with mobility, particularly for youth, low-income and low-educated individuals.},

This paper estimates long-term elasticities of housing supply to prices in OECD countries before exploring their drivers with a focus on policies. It finds a significant association between weaker supply responsiveness and a proxy measure for more restrictive land-use regulation. Besides, tighter rent controls are linked with lower supply elasticities. In turn, weak supply responsiveness implies that house prices rise more following stronger demand. The sensitivity of house prices to household income is also higher in countries that provide larger amounts of tax relief for homeowners.},

  abstract = {This article analyzes the conditions under which ethnic minorities intensify or moderate their protest behavior. While this question has been previously asked, we find that prior studies tend to generalize explanations across a varied set of ethnic groups and assume that causal conditions can independently explain whether groups are more or less mobilized. By contrast, this study employs a technique \textendash{} fuzzy-set analysis \textendash{} that is geared toward matching comparable groups to specific analytical configurations of causal factors to explain the choice for strong and weak protest. The analysis draws on a sample of 29 ethnic minorities in Europe and uses three group and two contextual conditions inspired by Gurr's ethnopolitical conflict model to understand why some ethnic minorities protest more frequently than others. We find that two group-related factors have the strongest claim to being generalizable: while territorial concentration is a necessary condition for strong protest, national pride is a necessary condition for weak protest. The contextual factors of level of democracy and ethnic fractionalization, which are often emphasized in the literature, and the perceived political discrimination of a group, are neither necessary nor individually sufficient conditions for either strong or weak protest. Hence, they help understanding some cases, but not all, and only in combination with other conditions. Such causal complexity, inherent in the phenomenon of ethnic protest, underscores the need for a case-sensitive, yet comparative, approach.},

Using a monthly out-of-sample period of 2011:01 to 2018:12, given an in-sample of 2006:01-2010:12, we find that indeed the new aligned investor sentiment index proposed in this paper has greater predictive power for housing returns than the a principal component analysis (PCA)-based sentiment index, used earlier in the literature. Moreover, shrinkage models utilizing the dis-aggregate sentiment proxies do not result in forecast improvement indicating that aligned sentiment index optimally exploits information in the dis-aggregate proxies of investor sentiment. Furthermore, when we let the machine learning models to choose from all key control variables and the aligned sentiment index, the forecasting accuracy is improved at all forecasting horizons, rather than just the short-run as witnessed under standard predictive regressions. This result suggests that machine learning methods are flexible enough to capture both structural change and time-varying information in a set of predictors simultaneously to forecast housing returns of China in a precise manner. Given the role of the real estate market in China's economic growth, our result of accurate forecasting of housing returns, based on investor sentiment and macroeconomic variables using state-of-the-art machine learning methods, has important implications for both investors and policymakers.},

This hypothesis marks an essential point of difference from neo-classical theory. Keynes showed that within the limits of the existing capacity utilisation, it is investment that determines savings. The correct way to extend this conclusion to the long run is the object of the present paper. In particular, it provides an assessment of the controversy on demand-led growth theory that has taken place since the mid-1980s between neo-Kaleckian and Sraffian authors, particularly those closer to the late Piero Garegnani's `surplus approach'. For the sake of the argument the Sraffian front is divided between a first and a second Sraffian position (the second defined as Sraffian supermultiplier approach). Although I argue that the second approach is the most promising, the dissention should not be over-emphasised, so will also often generically refer to Sraffian authors.},

Unfortunately, Diamond does not mention the origin of the concept in classical and pre-classical economics, nor does he pay much attention to debates in economic anthropology about the role of economic analysis in studying primitive and ancient economic formations. These debates were the subject of a recent book by Cedrini \& Marchionatti (2017), who dispute the neoclassical ``imperialist'' attempt to occupy the territory of economic anthropology. The authors rely on the institutionalist background provided by Karl Polanyi and his school and by other anthropologists of similar inspiration. Polanyians, however, fail to complete their institutional analysis by anchoring it to the changing modes of generation and distribution of the economic surplus. Yet their emphasis on the need to introduce institutions from the beginning, when speaking of economic surplus, should be taken into consideration by the classical surplus approach},

First, I argue that the discourse suffers from a number of theoretical problems \textendash{} its neglect of the causality running from development to institutions, its inability to see the impossibility of a free market, and its belief that the freest market and the strongest protection of private property rights are best for economic development. Second, I point out that the supposed evidence showing the superiority of `liberalized' institutions relies too much on cross-section econometric studies, which suffer from defective concepts, flawed measurements and heterogeneous samples. Finally, I argue that the currently dominant discourse on institutions and development has a poor understanding of changes in institutions themselves, which often makes it take unduly optimistic or pessimistic positions about the feasibility of institutional reform.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the relationship between consumption and wealth based on the concept of cointegration. The analysis focuses on French data over the 1987 - 2006 period. This relationship is expressed in two ways: in terms of Marginal Propensity to Consume out of wealth (MPC) and in terms of Elasticity of consumption to wealth. Three concepts of consumption are investigated: total households consumption expenditure, consumption excluding financial services and consumption excluding durable goods. Different estimators are also considered. Based on the MPC approach, when considered as permanent by households, an increase (decrease) in total wealth of one euro would lead to an increase (decrease) of 1 cent in total consumption. In terms of elasticity, an increase (decrease) of 10\% in wealth would imply also a relatively small impact of 0.8 to 1.1\% on consumption depending on the concept of consumption considered. In most cases, the effect of a change in financial wealth is bigger than of a change in housing wealth. The results indicate that the wealth effects in France are smaller than in the UK and US but close to what is observed in Italy. In addition, any deviation of the variables from their common trends is corrected at first by adjustments in disposable income in line with what has been uncovered by studies on Germany and consistent with the ''saving for the rainy days'' approach of Campbell (1987). But our results contrast with the seminal study of Lettau and Ludvigson (2004) in the US where asset prices make the bulk of the adjustment.},

  abstract = {For decades, performance comparisons between real estate and financial assets have repeatedly indicated that private real estate investment exhibits significantly higher risk-adjusted returns than publicly traded financial assets such as common stocks. That is, there is an apparent ``real estate risk premium puzzle.'' In this paper, we find that the seemingly superior risk-adjusted returns of real estate may be caused by inappropriate adoption of the conventional risk measure to real estate, a measure that completely ignores the non-i.i.d. nature of the asset's return distribution, as well as its illiquidity risk. We develop a modified performance measure\textemdash a Sharpe ratio for real estate\textemdash to capture the time-dependent nature of real estate risk by incorporating illiquidity risk in a closed-form formula. Our finding shows that, once the real estate risk is properly measured, the longstanding ``real estate risk premium puzzle'' no longer exists. Our approach also shows that real estate price risk over time can be accurately obtained through empirical estimation without relying on a simplification assumption of a particular distribution like the i.i.d. assumption.},

Second, housing financialization and land financialization jointly expand the production of properties and sustain capital accumulation. Third, the financialization of land and housing evolve over time. We conclude that the separate and related processes of housing and land financialization in China reflect the unique characteristics of the state ownership of land in China.},

Recently developed econometric techniques for panel unit root testing and heterogeneous panel cointegration analysis are employed. The empirical results provide clear support of a stable long-run relationship between housing investment, non-housing investment and GDP in China. We then estimate the long-run elasticity of GDP with respect to housing investment for the whole country as well as three sub regions. The variations across regions are detected and reasons for this fact are discussed. Based on the panel ECM, we show that there is bidirectional Granger causality between housing investment and GDP in both short run and long run for the whole country, while the impacts of housing investment on GDP behave strikingly differently in the three sub-regions of China.},

We find evidence of higher overall imbalance and its inter-ZIP code area dispersion in the booming years. Buyer search intensity diminishes the imbalance in boom and intensifies it in bust. Other revealed significant covariates have different effects under the two market conditions. Our model explains the liquidity imbalance variations on the ZIP code area level well, but not on the individual property level, highlighting the importance of regional idiosyncratic transaction dynamics.},

To that end, I first discuss three pillars of a well-functioning MIS as a conceptual underpinning - intermediation efficiency, affordability enhancement, and risk management. The historical survey proceeds based on four reasonably distinct time periods \textendash{} (1) the era of exploration (pre-1930s or pre-Great Depression era), (2) the era of institutionalization (1930s to 1960s), (3) the era of market-making (1970s and 1980s), and (4) the era of expansion and efficiency gain (1990s to Present). Based on the survey done, the lessons for other countries are organized under five topics: developing conforming mortgage product and market; extending the service to non-conforming segments; managing default and prepayment risks; managing systemic risk; and, developing an efficient intermediation process. The concluding remarks in the final section comprise the issue of right sequencing: that is, through what steps an MIS in a given country can be evolved toward a more market-based one that can deliver a higher degree of consumer welfare.},

Methods Cross-sectional survey data from 661 FLWs in 13 large health care employers were collected between 2007 and 2008 and analyzed using both regression and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. Principal Findings Supervisor support and team-based work practices were identified as necessary for high job satisfaction and high quality of care but not sufficient to achieve these outcomes unless implemented in tandem with other HPWP. Several configurations of HPWP were associated with either high job satisfaction or high quality of care. However, only one configuration of HPWP was sufficient for both: the combination of supervisor support, performance-based incentives, team-based work, and flexible work. These findings were consistent even after controlling for FLW demographics and employer type. Additional research is needed to clarify whether HPWP have differential effects on quality of care in direct care versus administrative workers. Conclusions High-performance work practices that integrate FLWs in health care teams and provide FLWs with opportunities for participative decision making can positively influence job satisfaction and perceived quality of care, but only when implemented as bundles of complementary policies and practices.},

  abstract = {Ambiguity and uncertainty are inherent in many historical alliances, decisions, and perceptions of International Relations (IR). Random factors, unreliable quantitative data, and inaccurate measurement do not cause all this qualitative fuzziness. Existing methods of statistical analysis and classical mathematical structures are ill equipped for modeling and analyzing this empirical real-world fuzziness. Zadeh's fuzzy sets theory provides a systematic framework for modeling qualitative fuzziness in foreign policy decision-making and international systems analysis. Basic fuzzy operations, linguistic variables, and fuzzy logic (viz., inference and algorithms) are explained informally with IR examples. Implications for theory building and computer simulation are discussed.},

  abstract = {The Great Financial Crisis of 2007-09 confirmed the vital importance of advancing our understanding of macrofinancial linkages, the two-way interactions between the real economy and the financial sector. The crisis was a bitter reminder of how sharp fluctuations in asset prices, credit and capital flows can have dramatic impact on the financial positions of households, corporations and sovereign nations. As fluctuations were amplified, the global financial system was brought to the brink of collapse and the deepest contraction in world output in more than half a century followed. Moreover, unprecedented challenges for fiscal, monetary and financial regulatory policies resulted. The crisis revived an old debate in the economics profession about the importance of macrofinancial linkages. Some argue that the crisis was a painful reminder of our limited knowledge of these linkages. Others claim that the profession had already made substantial progress in understanding them but that there was too much emphasis on narrow approaches and modelling choices. Yet, most also recognise that the absence of a unifying framework to study these two-way interactions has limited the practical applications of existing knowledge and impeded the formulation of policies. With these observations in mind, this paper presents a systematic review of the rapidly expanding literature on macrofinancial linkages. It first surveys the literature on the linkages between asset prices and macroeconomic outcomes. It then reviews the literature on the macroeconomic implications of financial imperfections. It also examines the global dimensions of macrofinancial linkages and documents the main stylized facts about the linkages between the real economy and the financial sector. The topic of macrofinancial linkages promises to remain an exciting area of research, given the many open questions and significant policy interest. The paper concludes with a discussion of possible directions for future research, stressing the need for richer theoretical models, more robust empirical work and better quality data so as to advance knowledge and help guide policymakers going forward},

The data contain household-level information on house prices and borrowing in a panel of homeowners, who refinance at regular and quasi-exogenous intervals. The data and setting allow us to develop an empirical approach that exploits house price variation coming from the idiosyncratic and exogenous timing of refinance events around the Great Recession. We present two main results. First, there is a clear and robust effect of house prices on borrowing. Second, the effect of house prices on borrowing can be explained largely by collateral effects. We study the collateral channel through a multivariate and nonparametric heterogeneity analysis of proxies for collateral and wealth effects.},

Using household level data on debt accumulation during 2001-2012, we show that low-income households in high-inequality regions accumulated less debt relative to income than their counterparts in lower-inequality regions, which negates the hypothesis. We argue instead that these patterns are consistent with supply-side interpretations of debt accumulation patterns during the 2000s. We present a model in which banks use applicants' incomes, combined with local income inequality, to infer the underlying type of the applicant, so that banks ultimately channel more credit toward lower-income applicants in low-inequality regions than high-inequality regions. We confirm the predictions of the model using data on individual mortgage applications in high- and low-inequality regions over this time period.},

Using an agentbased model (ABM), this paper seeks to measure the impact on house price cycles of two distinct borrower-based macroprudential instruments, namely loan-to-income and loan-to-value ratios. The use of an ABM allows for the consideration of the effects of these policies on the distribution of heterogeneous households. The paper shows that the relation between tightening an instrument and its effect on house price fluctuations may be highly non-linear, depending on the distribution of households for which the instrument becomes binding. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that the marginal effect of tightening one instrument generally depends on the calibration of the other instrument. From a policy perspective, these findings highlight the importance of using granular data - preferably at the household level - when calibrating borrower- based macroprudential instruments. Likewise, the findings demonstrate the importance of macroprudential authorities establishing a coherent framework where the effects of different measures are evaluated together.},

As with all techniques that become available in easy-to-use software packages, there is a danger that QCA will come to be used in a routinised manner, with not enough attention being paid to its particular strengths and weaknesses. Users of fsQCA in particular need to be very aware of particular problems that can arise when fuzzy logic lies behind their analyses. This paper aims to increase its readers' understanding of some of these problems and of some means by which they might be alleviated. We use a critical discussion of a recent paper by Freitag and Schlicht addressing social inequality in education in Germany as our vehicle. After summarising the substantive claims of the paper, we explain some key features of QCA. We subsequently discuss two main issues, (i) limited diversity and the various ways of using counterfactual reasoning to address it, and (ii) the logical paradoxes that can arise when using fsQCA. Making different choices than Freitag and Schlicht do in respect of dealing with these two issues, we undertake some reanalysis of their data, showing that their conclusions must be treated with some caution. We end by drawing some general lessons for users of QCA.},

As we argue, Mexico has been at the forefront of the tendencies and historical events that have defined financialization at the global level. Moreover, Mexico is alone among the world's largest economies in its continual application of public policies that serve the needs of a financialized economy. The degree to which such policies have been applied and their corresponding results have made Mexico one of the more interesting case studies in the causes and consequences of financialization.},

  abstract = {What are the economic consequences of an influenza pandemic? And given the pandemic, what are the economic costs and benefits of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI)? Using geographic variation in mortality during the 1918 Flu Pandemic in the U.S., we find that more exposed areas experience a sharp and persistent decline in economic activity. The estimates imply that the pandemic reduced manufacturing output by 18\%. The downturn is driven by both supply and demand-side channels. Further, building on findings from the epidemiology literature establishing that NPIs decrease influenza mortality, we use variation in the timing and intensity of NPIs across U.S. cities to study their economic effects. We find that cities that intervened earlier and more aggressively do not perform worse and, if anything, grow faster after the pandemic is over. Our findings thus indicate that NPIs not only lower mortality; they may also mitigate the adverse economic consequences of a pandemic.},

For two countries more similar than different in terms of geography, location, government and culture, Canada and the U.S. remain strikingly different in terms of housing finance. Public policy objectives toward housing followed quite different paths over the past seventy years and fundamental differences in banking practices have led to considerably different outcomes in terms of mortgage finance instruments in the two countries. In light of that, it is particularly surprising that homeownership rates do not diverge by much, reaching 67\% in the United States and 64\% in Canada by year-end 2000. We examine some of the differences in policy and in competitive practices between Canada and the U.S. in an attempt to illuminate why differences in rates and terms across the two countries still exist. While a part of the difference remains due to legal constraints concerning the finance of the domestic housing sector, we do not attempt an analysis of the legal structure and focus, rather, on the economics and public policy choices that have led to the observed differences.},

The model analyses the behaviour and the financial position of heterogeneous households as part of a dynamic macroeconomic system in which the financial decisions of firms and banks have distributional effects. The balance sheet structure of households is calibrated using the micro data of the Survey for Consumer Finances (SCF). We pay attention to four distribution channels of monetary policy: the interest income channel, the macroeconomic activity channel, the portfolio reallocation channel and the indebtedness channel. We find that the strength of the distributional effects of monetary policy depends on various behavioural and institutional factors, including the sensitivity of investment to profitability, the responsiveness of wages to unemployment, the household emulation motive, banks' credit provision behaviour and the responsiveness of the propensity to consume to changes in the interest rates. Prior knowledge of these factors is necessary in order to identify whether a monetary policy shock is likely to have an economically significant impact on inequality.},

Emphasis is placed on the impact of climate change damages on the price of financial assets and the financial position of firms and banks. The model is estimated and calibrated using global data and simulations are conducted for the period 2016\textendash 2120. Four key results arise. First, by destroying the capital of firms and reducing their profitability, climate change is likely to gradually deteriorate the liquidity of firms, leading to a higher rate of default that could harm both the financial and the non-financial corporate sector. Second, climate change damages can lead to a portfolio reallocation that can cause a gradual decline in the price of corporate bonds. Third, climate-induced financial instability might adversely affect credit expansion, exacerbating the negative impact of climate change on economic activity. Fourth, the implementation of a green corporate QE programme can reduce climate-induced financial instability and restrict global warming. The effectiveness of this programme depends positively on the responsiveness of green investment to changes in bond yields.},

  abstract = {Wynne Godley and Hyman Minsky were two macroeconomists who `saw the crisis coming'. This paper develops a simple macrodynamic model that synthesises some key perspectives of their analytical frameworks. The model incorporates Godley's financial balances approach and postulates that private sector's propensity to spend is driven by a stock-flow norm (the target net private debt-to-income ratio) that changes endogenously via a Minsky mechanism. It also includes two fiscal rules: a Maastricht-type fiscal rule, according to which the fiscal authorities adjust the government expenditures based on a target net government debt ratio; and a Godley\textendash Minsky fiscal rule, which links government expenditures with private indebtedness following a counter-cyclical logic. The analysis shows that (i) the interaction between the propensity to spend and net private indebtedness can generate cycles and instability; (ii) instability is more likely when the propensity to spend responds strongly to deviations from the stock-flow norm and when the expectations that determine the stock-flow norm are highly sensitive to the economic cycle; (iii) the Maastricht-type fiscal rule is destabilising while the Godley\textendash Minsky fiscal rule is stabilising; and (iv) the paradox of debt can apply both to the private sector and the government sector.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a stock-flow-fund ecological macroeconomic model that combines the stock-flow consistent approach of Godley and Lavoie with the flow-fund model of Georgescu-Roegen. The model has the following key features. First, monetary and physical stocks and flows are explicitly formalised taking into account the accounting principles and the laws of thermodynamics. Second, Georgescu-Roegen's distinction between stock-flow and fund-service resources is adopted. Third, output is demand-determined but supply constraints might arise either due to environmental damages or due to the exhaustion of natural resources. Fourth, climate change influences directly the components of aggregate demand. Fifth, finance affects macroeconomic activity and the materialisation of investment plans that determine ecological efficiency. The model is calibrated using global data. Simulations are conducted to investigate the trajectories of key environmental, macroeconomic and financial variables under (i) different assumptions about the sensitivity of economic activity to the leverage ratio of firms and (ii) different types of green finance policies.},

  abstract = {The past two decades have seen a sharp renewal of interest in the Kaleckian models of growth and distribution. These models have been put to so much use that it made us wonder if this trend was based on their ability to generate macroeconomic equilibrium variables located within a reasonable range of some conceivable economic reality. While the Kaleckians spend much time debating how much their models are wage-led vs. profit-led, our work lies upstream of these questions, for we are investigating the Kaleckian models' existence properties. We conducted a series of simulations based on a basic, three-equation model: an investment function, a savings function and an equation for the firms' objectives. By estimating the parameters composing these different functions without recourse to econometrics but by means of an economic diagnostic, and by specifying an assumed range of value for the equilibrium variable, we tested these models' ability to produce plausible results. We also tested the models' stability property. Although stability is often put forth as a prerequisite in the study of such models, in the Kaleckian literature the question of how plausible is the stability is rarely raised.},

We reviewed Pasinetti and Foley models showing that if we use the traditional definition of capital, i.e., capital as the value of productive resources (i) r {$>$} g is a necessary condition for the existence of balanced growth, and it will not lead to an explosive process of income concentration and (ii) r {$>$} i is a necessary condition for a financially robust growth path. Thus we conclude that from a post-Keynesian perspective, Piketty's argument that the root of the increase of inequality in capitalism is that the capital return rate is higher than the growth rate of the economy is wrong.},

The results con\textregistered rm that for some countries, \textregistered nancial spread variables do contain some information about future output growth and in\textasciimacron ation, with the yield curve and the reverse yield gap performing best. However, the relatively poor out-of-sample forecasting performance and/or parameter instability suggests that the need for caution in using spread variables for forecasting in EU countries.

Capital adequacy- and reserve requirements are analysed for their e{$\carriagereturn$}ect on the risk of severe downturns. We develop an agent-based macroeconomic model in which financial contagion is transmitted through balance sheets in an endogenous firm-bank network, that incorporates firm bankruptcy and heterogeneity among banks to capture the fact that contagion e{$\carriagereturn$}ects are bank-specific. Using concepts from the empirical literature to identify amplitude and duration of recessions and expansions we show that more stringent liquidity regulations are best to dampen output fluctuations and prevent severe downturns. Under such regulations both leverage along expansions and amplitude of recessions become smaller. More stringent capital requirements induce larger output fluctuations and lead to deeper, more fragile recessions. This indicates that the capital adequacy requirement is pro-cyclical and therefore not advisable as a measure to prevent financial contagion.},

  abstract = {Purpose The aim of this paper is to assess whether the inclusion of the rental housing market affect the dynamics of the real business cycles (RBCs). Design/methodology/approach For this investigation, the authors model and estimate two dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) versions for the US economy, one with and one without the presence of residential rent. Findings The findings provide evidence that the inclusion of the rental housing market can improve the assessment of public policies and the projection of scenarios in the face of sudden macroeconomic shocks. The addition of this secondary housing market augments the effect of total factor productivity (TFP) shock on output and consumption. In addition, it increases the effect of the credit shock on the demand for housing. The latter highlights the role of credit for the real estate market. Therefore, the authors recommend that analysts and macro-prudential authorities consider adding it to their models. Originality/value The findings provide evidence that the inclusion of the rental housing market can improve the assessment of public policies and the projection of scenarios in the face of sudden macroeconomic shocks.},

  abstract = {In order to assess transmission mechanisms between global and domestic house prices, and possibly contagion effects, we use a large database of macroeconomic variables for OECD countries.We extract common factors to summarize the comovements of the variables and include them in stationary FAVAR models. We mainly focus on the ``pandemic`` view of contagion where local shocks, originating from a country or a local housing market, spread out to other domestic housing markets. An interesting finding is that, even allowing for other channels of international transmission (through global interest rates or activity), the US real house prices, which appear to be exogenous in the US dynamics, unidirectionally causes the international house price factor, which in turn causes the domestic real house price growth for several countries. The channels of contagion from the US appears therefore to be either direct, through house prices (in particular in the UK or Spain), or indirect through other variables.},

The novelty of the originate-to-distribute model of finance, based on the securitization of mortgage loans, is that it has assembled the machinery to accelerate the process. The limit to credit expansion derives from the potential (full capacity) growth of output. If there is a systematic gap between both rates, the credit-led growth will eventually become a debt- burdened growth.},

From this basis, we build a couple of models that may lead to self-contained or explosive cycles. Even in the first case, there is a risk of a financial collapse when certain variables move far away from their long-term equilibrium positions. In order to tame the cycle and avoid extreme positions, governments should ban the expansion of credit money for the purchase of assets and introduce permanent checks to risky credit.},

  author = {D'Elia, E and Gabriele, S},
  pages = {32},
  abstract = {Functional income distribution can be an important driver of inequality. When the market remuneration of labour and capital is very uneven across individuals, as they have been in recent decades, the personal distribution of income tends to polarise, jeopardising social cohesion. This explains a renewed interest in functional distribution. Nevertheless, the role of self-employed income has been often misunderstood in estimating factor income shares. National accounts provide estimates of the compensation of employees and the operating surplus, but do not refer to self-employed workers as a specific productive factor, implicitly including their income in the `mixed income' aggregate and in some other minor items. Most analysts estimate the income of self-employed workers by attributing to them the average unit compensation of the employees, although in fact this is not necessarily consistent with the GDP estimates. Other estimates take a fixed share of the `mixed income', usually the same for every country. When national accounts are very detailed, as in the case of Italy, under some assumptions it is possible to accurately estimate self-employment income from sectors' nonfinancial accounts. In this paper we analyse four estimation approaches for self-employed incomes, since only the total amount of `mixed income' received by households is available for most countries. We analyse the data of the OECD countries focusing mainly on eight large economies: the US, Japan, the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy. The results are somehow unexpected. First of all, evaluating the income of the self-employed properly, the overall labour share is declining much faster than reported by the official data in some countries, and more countries showed a decrease in the 2000s. Indeed, the real unit compensation of the self-employed declined significantly in most of the eight countries (and in some of the others) after the mid or the end of the nineties, since self-employment has been used extensively to reduce the overall labour cost. Unit labour cost (ULC) also increased much slower (or even declined more) after 2000 in most countries, shedding new light on the pattern of international competitiveness and the drivers of inflation. The share of operative surplus of non-financial and financial corporations, properly recalculated, has exhibited different dynamics, whereas the component related to imputed rentals of owner occupied houses played an unexpectedly important role. Finally, the mark-up on variable production costs has been higher than expected and its evolution has been faster in most countries than what reported before, showing a lower sensitivity to the business cycle.},

  abstract = {Schumpeter asserted that there were two types of business cycle theories: one in which cycles reflected dampened economic behavior and another in which cycles reflect explosive economic behavior. Both of these theories allowed that cycles could be either monotonic or oscillating. In this working paper, Domenico Delli Gatti, Mauro Gallegati, and Levy Institute Distinguished Scholar Hyman P. Minsky expand the alternative types of theory to three by adding one in which cycles reflect nonoscillating time series, wavelike motions, and incoherent behavior, such as those witnessed in times of runaway inflation and debt deflations. In Gatti, Gallegati, and Minsky's business cycle theory, "cycles result from the combination of endogenous interactions that can lead to incoherence" and the effects of institutions to contain these tendencies in the economy. The authors construct an accelerator-multiplier model that reflects the idea that "times series that can generate smooth growth and well-behaved cycles as possible transitory results of the economic process, but that also allow for intermittent conditions conducive to the emergence of incoherence or turbulence." This turbulence, however, can be contained by institutional factors that act as circuit breakers on the economy. Whenever institutionally determined values dominate endogenously determined values, the path of the economy is broken and an interactive process, which starts with new initial conditions, generates future values. Specifically, whenever the economy threatens to behave incoherently, these stabilizers, whether built-in or activated by government authority, prevent the economy from continuing on the prior determined path.},

A classic problem in comparative studies has been the presence of too many variables and too few cases. One traditional solution to this problem has been to study subsystems within a system. However, the approach has fundamental limitations: it cannot analyse subsystems from different contexts, nor can it determine how conditions on the system level influence subsystems. By proposing four additions to traditional methodology, this article offers a new method of comparing subsystems from different contexts in order to analyse the effect of context on subsystems. The author also illustrates how CMA can be combined with Qualitative Comparative Analysis and Fuzzy-set, thereby enabling these methods to be used in the study of subsystem and context effects.},

  abstract = {Contextual analyses are essential in comparative research, as they investigate the importance of contextual conditions for causal relationships. During the last decades, an increasing number of comparative studies have also focused on how contextual conditions affect causal relationships. At the same time, new comparative methods have been developed based on set-theoretical logics. Two of the most prominent methods are csQCA and fsQCA, which are used in comparative studies with increasing frequency. However, the conventional design for contextual analysis is still based on quantitative methods and the use of interaction-factors. This article discusses why the use of interaction-factors is not suitable together with QCA-methods. Instead of the conventional design, the article presents an alternative design for contextual analyses with QCA-methods grounded on subgroup-design. Based on one recently-developed methodology comparative multilevel analysis (CMA), some guidelines for performing contextual analyses with two set-theoretical methods (csQCA and fsQCA) are presented. As illustrated with examples, the combination of CMA and QCA provides opportunities to use QCA for contextual analysis.},

The slowdown has been greatest in the advanced economies, particularly in the United States, where the housing market correction continues to exacerbate financial stress.

Policymakers around the world are facing a diverse and fast-moving set of challenges, and although each country's circumstances differ, in an increasingly multipolar world it will be essential to meet these challenges broadly, taking full account of cross-border interactions.

This article considers the institutions of economics from a theoretical perspective, applying to economics itself ideas that have been used to study institutions in the economy and other domains. The institutions of economics are not often treated as such, but deserve attention not only because they impact the discipline, but also because they interact with economic reality, including institutions in the economy. Particularly important are the mental models socially shared by academic economists. Conformity with these institutions and their sharing can be explained by various social factors, such as the perception of legitimacy or naturality, sanctions, uncertainty, increasing returns to adoption, informational differences, lack of power, and habits. A conventional model is adopted, at least in part, because other agents adopt it, and it is arbitrary in the sense that a non-inferior alternative to it is conceivable. An epistemic social norm implies possible sanctions and may be internalized as legitimate. Despite the profound cognitive and motivational influence of a discipline's institutions, together with other conservative forces, cases of non-conformity do occur and promote change. Prestigious academics are often successful innovators.},

More specifically, academics who do not comply with these rules are subject to punishment, while conformists may be rewarded. At the same time, many supporters of mainstream economics have internalized these rules as legitimate, in part because of the prestige of their advocates. Social sanctions and internalization characterize social norms. These institutions are also conventions. Through various mechanisms, some academics follow these rules at least in part because others have done so; in addition, the prevailing rules are not necessarily superior to existing or conceivable alternatives.The combination of social norms and conventions may have negative consequences for the discipline.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the effects of household indebtedness and housing wealth on consumption. To identify exogenous movements of housing wealth and leverage, we estimate housing supply elasticities for New Zealand urban centers. We construct synthetic panel series by using household survey data to estimate the marginal propensity to consume out of exogenous changes in housing wealth, while controlling for the household leverage ratio. Our empirical results show that, on average, the marginal propensity to consume out of housing wealth is about 3 cents out of one dollar. But it is larger, about 4 cents, in response to falling house wealth than to increasing housing wealth, about 2 cents. We further investigate the role of household indebtedness in accounting for the asymmetric effect. Our findings suggest that household leverage reinforces the housing wealth effect in a housing bust, but dampens the housing wealth effect in a boom.},

With the help of a stock-flow consistent model it will be demonstrated then how increasing inequality, depending on a countries institutional structure and regulatory framework, affects growth differently, explaining the occurrence of both regime types. Based on the insights of the theoretical discussion and the model results, a foresight exercise will be performed examining how further increase in inequality might affect development of economies around the world but particularly of the Euro area.},

For this end, it combines the rich literature on Germany's institutional structure with the more macroeconomic oriented literature on financializaton. With the combination of those different perspectives the article sheds light on the reasons for the spread of financialization and the specific forms it has taken in Germany.},

  abstract = {The present paper offers a fundamental critique of the macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy after it surveys the theoretical and empirical literature on the macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy. It emphasizes the importance of the fiscal policy after reviewing the revolution of almost all economic schools and bringing them in one summarized figure; the paper links the developmental role of the fiscal policy with the objectives and measures of the economic transformation. Thus, the importance of this study can be seen from several perspectives: First, it reviews the theoretical harvest of fiscal policy and provides a comparison between the main revolutionary Economic thoughts; the classical school, Keynesian school, and monetarist school. Then it turns to conclude the fiscal policy from the new consensus mainstream economic schools. Finally, the study presents grouped and classified empirical pieces of evidence as it divides those empirical studies into two groups; the first for developed economies and the second for developing ones. So the study is important also for the policymakers as well as scholars as it gives its recommendations upon the last analysis in the form of `policy implications'. The paper also presents a deeper look into the evaluation approaches of the macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy at the empirical level. Thus it is useful for both researchers and decision makers.},

  abstract = {We embed a competitive search model of the real estate market into a heterogeneous agent setting where households face credit constraints and idiosyncratic turnover shocks. Households can accumulate a risk-free asset to build a down payment and to smooth non-housing consumption. There is an inelastic supply of identical homes. The model is ``block recursive''. In equilibrium wealthier home buyers sort into submarkets with higher prices and shorter buying times. We identify a novel amplification mechanism, arising from sorting, by which demand shocks can substantially affect housing prices. In particular, lowering down payment requirements induces entry of new buyers in the market and higher asset accumulation by current searchers, as these agents target more expensive (less congested) submarkets. This affects the distribution of prices and trading probabilities, and thereby the wealth distribution. Our quantitative results suggest that the effects on the long-run level and dispersion of housing prices can be significant.},

Its `demand side' explanation is based on a long-run equilibrium position featuring a negative natural rate of interest. The first objective of the paper is to show that this concept is not acceptable in a neoclassical framework. This claim is made after studying plausibility of the hypotheses and logical consistency of the position in: the Euler equation, the Wicksellian/IS-LM model, the Ramsey model, and the Overlapping generations model. The second objective is to show that the long-lasting deficit-spending policy proposal, which is remarkable and should be welcomed, is inconsistent with the neoclassical framework. Without a negative natural interest rate and the zero lower bound, arguing so forcefully for deficit-spending would not be possible. The Secular Stagnation Theory can be strengthened and consistently proposed if analysis is placed outside the neoclassical framework. Demand-led models are advocated to be better equipped to account for stagnation.},

As it turns out, the dynamics of our model is driven by a two-dimensional nonlinear map which may display irregular boom and bust housing price cycles, as repeatedly observed in many actual markets.

  abstract = {The paper presents an agent-based model to study the interaction between income inequality and prudential regulations in a macroeconomic framework characterized by consumer debt. Simulation results show that income inequality is detrimental to both macro and financial stability as it leads to higher credit demands, higher unemployment rates, economic volatility, and financial fragility. Besides the importance of consumers' leveraging, deleveraging externalities are found to be equally important for the emergence of crises and financial fragility because of the liquidity risk they entail. Minsky moments are also observed; they are related to consumers' prudential behavior and their beliefs about the macroeconomic conditions. Concerning the policy relevance of our investigation, simulations allow us to highlight that the effectiveness of prudential regulation depends on the phase of the business cycle and that there is not a ``one-size-fits-all'' regulation. This study emphasizes that regulatory constraints should take into account the features of the economic agents, such as the distribution of income and their willingness to borrow, in addition to the features of the financial sector.},

Are such processes able to account for the statistical regularities which industrial structures and dynamics display? In this work we address this question by means of a simple multi-firm model formalizing the mechanisms of learning and selection. As such, despite its simplicity, the model is able to robustly reproduce an ensemble of empirical stylized facts, including ample heterogeneity in productivity distributions, persistent market turbulence, and fat-tailed distribution of growth rates.},

  abstract = {This work nests the Agent-Based macroeconomic perspective into the earlier history of macroeconomics. We discuss how the discipline in the 70's took a perverse path relying on models grounded on fictitious rational representative agent in order to try to pathetically circumvent aggregation and coordination problems. The Great Recession was a natural experiment for macroeconomics, showing the inadequacy of the predominant theoretical framework grounded on DSGE models. After discussing the pathological fallacies of the DSGE-based approach, we claim that macroeconomics should consider the economy as a complex evolving system, i.e. as an ecology populated by heterogenous agents, whose far-from-equilibrium interactions continuously change the structure of the system. This in turn implies that more is different: macroeconomics cannot be shrink to representative-agent micro, but agents' complex interactions lead to emergence of new phenomena and hierarchical structure at the macro level. This is what is taken into account by agent-based models, which provide a novel way to model complex economies from the bottom-up, with sound empirically-based microfoundations. We present the foundations of Agent-Based macroeconomics and we discuss how the contributions of this special issue push its frontier forward. Finally, we conclude by discussing the ways ahead for the fully acknowledgement of agent-based models as the standard way of theorizing in macroeconomics.},

On the occasion of this anniversary, the authors of this report have been led to contribute a series of papers in relation with this event. The report gathers 8 papers, and thus covers many issues in relation with fuzzy sets. The first two provide overviews about the historical emergence of fuzzy sets, and the first steps of the fuzzy set research in France. The third one discusses the scientific legacy of fuzzy sets after 50 years. The next two survey some developments of possibility theory, focusing on two specific issues: the elicitation of qualitative or quantitative possibility distributions, and the forms of inconsistency representable in a possibilistic logic setting. The 6th paper (with Davide Ciucci) surveys the different forms of hybridation between fuzzy set and rough set theories using squares and cubes of opposition. The 7th paper discusses granular computing from different theoretical viewpoints including extensional fuzzy sets, formal concept analysis and rough sets. The last paper (with James C. Bezdek) presents a selected, annotated bibliography of fuzzy set contributions based on representative papers chosen by IEEE CIS Fuzzy Systems pioneers.},

We test this hypothesis using aggregate time series data on FHA and conventional mortgage originations. FHA loans are more expensive for borrowers but provide federal guarantees which protect lenders against default losses. For this reason, FHA loans should be subject to easier credit constraints than conventional mortgages, and the FHA share of mortgage originations should increase with aggregate default risk. Default risk is proxied by a bond rate quality spread consistent with previous studies. Our results imply that default risk-induced mortgage rationing persists in the post disintermediation era, but that FHA programs help offset the overall impact of rationing on housing markets.},

This extension term consists of the inflation gap between consumer and house price inflation multiplied by an average loan-to-value ratio and the real house prices. The empirical relevance of our finding is confirmed by a VECM. We provide evidence that the dynamics of residential investment in Germany are significantly influenced by the extended user costs (i.e. basic user costs plus the extension term) as well as by net financial wealth.

  abstract = {Abstract Single necessary (but not sufficient) conditions are critically important for business theory and practice. Without them, the outcomes cannot occur, and other conditions cannot compensate for this absence. Currently two analytical approaches are available for identifying single necessary conditions: Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA), which was recently developed, and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), which is a more established approach. FsQCA normally focuses on sufficient but not necessary configurations, but can also identify necessary but not sufficient conditions. This study uses NCA to analyze two examples of empirical datasets published in the Journal of Business Research that use fsQCA to identify single necessary conditions. A comparison of the results of NCA and fsQCA shows that NCA can identify more necessary conditions than fsQCA and can specify the level of the condition that is required for a given level of the outcome.},

It argues that using these models can help heterodox researchers to communicate with mainstream economists and might help to further one's personal academic career, but that such a strategy comes along with the risk of having to accept other, very questionable policy conclusions and of stabilizing the use of the DSGE models in mainstream economics, hence potentially delaying a Kuhnean-type `scientific revolution' in macroeconomics.},

Traditional data analyses approaches (e.g., correlation or multiple regression) are not appropriate for testing or inducing such statements. This article proposes necessary condition analysis (NCA) as a general and straightforward methodology for identifying necessary conditions in data sets. The article presents the logic and methodology of necessary but not sufficient contributions of organizational determinants (e.g., events, characteristics, resources, efforts) to a desired outcome (e.g., good performance). A necessary determinant must be present for achieving an outcome, but its presence is not sufficient to obtain that outcome. Without the necessary condition, there is guaranteed failure, which cannot be compensated by other determinants of the outcome. This logic and its related methodology are fundamentally different from the traditional sufficiency-based logic and methodology. Practical recommendations and free software are offered to support researchers to apply NCA.},

  abstract = {The main objective of the qualitative comparative analysis is to find solutions that display sufficient configurations of causal conditions leading to the presence of an outcome. These solutions should be less complex than the original observed configurations, as parsimonious as possible, without sacrificing the sufficiency requirement. Sufficiency and parsimony are two requirements that act in opposition, and an optimal solution is one that accommodates both. There are different search strategies that lead to different types of solutions, with an ongoing debate about which solution type is closest to the true, underlying causal structure. This article presents the different logics behind each simplification system in order to explain how and why they lead to different results and introduces the concept of ``robust sufficiency'' to clear the debate. It analyses the correctness ratios for the different solution type and provides an improved set of procedures to measure correctness that captures the best features from each system. Out of the competition between the conservative and the parsimonious search strategies, the intermediate solution emerges as the best hybrid that is suitable for causal analysis, outperforming the parsimonious solution in recovering a known (even parsimonious) causal structure.},

  abstract = {It has long been argued that an increase in inequality increases the rate of economic growth by increasing the share of income going to profit recipients, whose saving contributes to capital accumulation, so that growth is profit-led. A more recent tradition argues that an increase in equality and a rise in the wage share can increase growth by increasing consumption and investment demand, so that growth is wage-led. Bhaduri and Marglin and others argue, however, that even if economic activity is demand-determined, a shift in income distribution towards profits can increase output and growth. This paper examines how a reduction in inequality affects economic growth, thereby contributing to the debate on wage-led and profit-led growth and broadening it to focus on inequality rather than the profit share. It does so by reviewing and re-examining the cases in which workers save, the determinants of investment, and the open economy, three issues that have been emphasized in the literature.},

  abstract = {This paper extends a Steindlian model of growth and income distribution to incorporate borrowing by consumers. It shows that borrowing by consumers can improve growth prospects in the short run by increasing consumer demand. However, in the longer run the effects of increasing consumer borrowing are ambiguous because, by increasing consumer debt, it redistributes income towards the rich who have a higher propensity to save, thereby possibly depressing aggregate demand and growth despite the borrowing-induced expansion. The problem may be exacerbated by financial considerations involving the increase of the interest rate due to greater borrowing, but these considerations are not necessary for it. The problem is more likely to occur when autonomous investment demand is weak, i.e. when borrowing-induced consumption increases are most required to counter tendencies towards stagnation.},

Since this framework examines how variables are determined in equilibrium, second, dynamics behind equilibria are examined, focusing on goods market and labor market changes. Third, the framework is extended in a variety of ways to examine additional models addressing productivity growth and technical change, money and inflation, finance and debt, additional distributional considerations, multisector issues, open economy questions, and the environment.

One of the most relevant controversy concerns the role of fiscal policy. In order to present a different theoretical approach and discuss the role of fiscal policy, in this paper, we present an agent based micro-macro multisectoral model to analyze the fiscal policy in a complex evolutionary economy. We evaluate the impact of a set of different fiscal rules in terms of short run fluctuations and long-term growth. The main motivations are both to influence the public debate and to present an important theoretical tool. In terms of economic policy debate, in particular, we analyze the impact of the approval of a new fiscal rule that prevents any real growth of federal public expenditures for at least ten years in Brazil. Based on the simulation model, we compare 5 different combinations of fiscal policy on how they affect macro variables, such as GDP growth rate, GDP volatility and likelihood of crisis. We also test how each fiscal policy combination reacts to an external crisis. Results show that all scenarios that impose a tighter constraint to government spending present signs of self-defeating fiscal consolidation, including effect on firms' indebtedness. On the other hand, unconstrained countercyclical policy prevents contagious effect of external crisis, leading to a better economic performance and reducing the likelihood of crisis.},

We consider two main sources of inefficiency: underdiversification (``down'') and nonparticipation in risky asset markets (``out''). While a few households are very poorly diversified, most Swedish households outperform the Sharpe ratio of their domestic stock index through international diversification. Financially sophisticated households invest more efficiently but also more aggressively, and overall they incur higher return losses from underdiversification. The return cost of nonparticipation is smaller by almost one-half when we take account of the fact that nonparticipants would likely be inefficient investors.},

Platforms sell broadband Internet access services to residential consumers and may set fees to content and application providers on the Internet. When access is monopolized, cross-group externalities (network effects) can give a rationale for network neutrality regulation (requiring zero fees to content providers): there exist parameter ranges for which network neutrality regulation increases the total surplus compared to the fully private optimum at which the monopoly platform imposes positive fees on content providers. However, for other parameter values, network neutrality regulation can decrease total surplus. Extending the model to a duopoly of residential broadband ISPs, we again find parameter values such that network neutrality regulation increases total surplus suggesting that network neutrality regulation could be warranted even when some competition is present. \'O 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Like differential saving rates, differential rates of return matter for post Keynesian theory, because they impact the income and wealth distribution and add an explosive element to growth models. We show that differential rates of return matter empirically by merging data on household balance sheets with long-run returns for individual asset categories. We find that (a) the composition of wealth differentiates three socioeconomic groups: 30\% are asset-poor, 65\% are middle-class home owners, and the top 5\% are business-owning capitalists; (b) rates of return rise across all groups; and (c) rates of return broadly follow a log-shaped function across the distribution, where inequality in the lower half of the distribution is higher than in the upper half. If socioeconomic groups are collapsed into the bottom 95\% workers and top 5\% capitalists, then rates of return are 5.6\% for the former and 7.2\% for the latter.},

  abstract = {US net capital inflows drive the international synchronization of house price growth. An increase (decrease) in US net capital inflows improves (tightens) US dollar funding conditions for non-US global banks, leading them to increase (decrease) foreign lending to third-party borrowing countries. This induces a synchronization of lending across borrowing countries, which translates into an international synchronization of mortgage credit growth and, ultimately, house price growth. Importantly, this synchronization is driven by non-US global banks' common but heterogenous exposure to US dollar funding conditions, not by the common exposure of borrowing countries to non-US global banks. Our results identify a novel channel of international transmission of US dollar funding conditions: As these conditions vary over time, borrowing country pairs whose non-US global creditor banks are more dependent on US dollar funding exhibit higher house price synchronization.},

We discuss the relevance of each of these three aspects and argue that carefully considering these will improve the quality of QCA applications.},

  abstract = {The relationship between co-integration and error correction models, first suggested in Granger (1981), is here extended and used to develop estimation procedures, tests, and empirical examples. If each element of a vector of time series x\textsubscript{t} first achieves stationarity after differencing, but a linear combination {$<$}tex-math{$>\$\backslash$}alpha \^\{\textbackslash prime \}x\_\{t\}\${$<$}/tex-math{$>$} is already stationary, the time series x\textsubscript{t} are said to be co-integrated with co-integrating vector {$\alpha$}. There may be several such co-integrating vectors so that {$\alpha$} becomes a matrix. Interpreting {$<$}tex-math{$>\$\backslash$}alpha \^\{\textbackslash prime \}x\_\{t\}=0\${$<$}/tex-math{$>$} as a long run equilibrium, co-integration implies that deviations from equilibrium are stationary, with finite variance, even though the series themselves are nonstationary and have infinite variance. The paper presents a representation theorem based on Granger (1983), which connects the moving average, autoregressive, and error correction representations for co-integrated systems. A vector autoregression in differenced variables is incompatible with these representations. Estimation of these models is discussed and a simple but asymptotically efficient two-step estimator is proposed. Testing for co-integration combines the problems of unit root tests and tests with parameters unidentified under the null. Seven statistics are formulated and analyzed. The critical values of these statistics are calculated based on a Monte Carlo simulation. Using these critical values, the power properties of the tests are examined and one test procedure is recommended for application. In a series of examples it is found that consumption and income are co-integrated, wages and prices are not, short and long interest rates are, and nominal GNP is co-integrated with M2, but not M1, M3, or aggregate liquid assets.},

We model a wealth effect of housing wealth into households consumption budget as the main link between the housing market and the real economy. Banks will extend mortgages to households only if the expenditure on housing, as a proportion of total income, is lower than a given threshold ({$\beta$}). Different simulations are preformed to see how changing {$\beta$}effects the housing market and the real economy. We find that by lowering the constraint on bank lending, i.e. increasing {$\beta$}, housing prices boom, positively affecting the real economy},

Here we introduce a new graph-based approach for incorporating a spatial component in a large-scale urban housing agent-based model (ABM). The model explicitly captures several social and economic factors that influence the agents' decision-making behaviour (such as fear of missing out, their trend following aptitude, and the strength of their submarket outreach), and interprets these factors in spatial terms. The proposed model is calibrated and validated with the housing market data for the Greater Sydney region. The ABM simulation results not only include predictions for the overall market, but also produce area-specific forecasting at the level of local government areas within Sydney. In addition, the simulation results elucidate movement patterns across submarkets, in both spatial and homeownership terms, including renters, first-time home buyers, as well as local and overseas investors.},

We sketch a simple theoretical framework that conceptualizes existing validation approaches, which we examine along three different dimensions: (i) comparison between artificial and real-world data; (ii) calibration and estimation of model parameters; and (iii) parameter space exploration. Finally, we discuss open issues in the field of ABM validation and estimation. In particular, we argue that more research efforts should be devoted toward advancing hypothesis testing in ABM, with specific emphasis on model stationarity and ergodicity.},

  abstract = {A recent literature incorporates autonomous non-capacity creating expenditures in a medium-run and a longrun Kaleckian growth models. We analyze this literature from the perspective of the Sraffian Supermultiplier model. From this point of view, traditional Kaleckian growth models have three important limitations: they cannot generate a tendency towards normal capacity utilization; they do not imply a positive relationship between the rate of output growth and the investment-output ratio; and they fail to give a growth-determining role to autonomous non-capacity creating expenditures in the interpretation of real demand-led growth processes. The medium-run model cannot completely overcome all these three limitations and can generate implausible behavior under certain conditions. The long-run model can overcome all three limitations because it combines an investment function based on the capital stock adjustment principle with an endogenous determination of the saving ratio that does not resort to changes in income distribution. Moreover, we argue that an analysis based on the Harrodian instability principle cannot be properly used in the investigation of the stability condition of the Supermultiplier equilibrium of the long-run model. Instead, we suggest that the stability condition of such an equilibrium should be interpreted as a generalized Keynesian stability condition, according to which the propensity to spend should have a value lower than one throughout the whole disequilibrium path of the model.},

  abstract = {Most empirical models of investment rely on the assumption that firms are able to respond to prices set in centralized securities markets (through the "cost of capital" or "q"). An alternative approach emphasizes the importance of cash flow as a determinant of investment spending, because of a "financing hierarchy," in which internal finance has important cost advantages over external finance. We build on recent research concerning imperfections in markets for equity and debt. This work suggests that some firms do not have sufficient access to external capital markets to enable them to respond to changes in the cost of capital, asset prices, or tax-based investment incentives. To the extent that firms are constrained in their ability to raise funds externally, investment spending may be sensitive to the availability of internal finance. That is, investment may display "excess sensitivity" to movements in cash flow. In this paper, we work within the q theory of investment, and examine the importance of a financing hierarchy created by capital-market imperfections. Using panel data on individual manufacturing firms, we compare the investment behavior of rapidly growing firms that exhaust all of their internal finance with that of mature firms paying dividends. We find that q values remain very high for significant periods of time for firms paying no dividends, relative to those for mature firms. We also find that investment is more sensitive to cash flow for the group of firms that our model implies is most likely to face external finance constraints. These results are consistent with the augmented model we propose, which takes into account different financing regimes for different groups of firms. Some extensions and implications for public policy are discussed at the end.},

Theoretically, the steady-state growth path may be dynamically stable or unstable, but empirical calibration favours stability.

While a minimum unemployment rate ultimately imposes a supply constraint on growth, empirical results show that a wide range of growth rates are feasible across different demand regimes.

Este desempenho \'e analisado por meio de um modelo de crescimento de causa\c{c}\~ao cumulativa liderado pela demanda de influ\^encia kaleckiana e kaldoriana que integra distribui\c{c}\~ao de renda, demanda e produtividade do trabalho em perspectiva setorial. O objetivo do trabalho \'e analisar os impactos cumulativos do crescimento do sal\'ario real sobre o crescimento da demanda e produtividade do trabalho durante o per\'iodo entre 2004 a 2013 na economia brasileira. Um modelo econom\'etrico de dados em painel \'e utilizado, baseado, dentre outras fontes, em dados da matriz insumo-produto brasileira. A presen\c{c}a de endogeneidade nas vari\'aveis do modelo \'e tratada pelo m\'etodo dos momentos generalizados. Os resultados mostram que o crescimento da demanda no per\'iodo foi liderado pelo aumento da parcela salarial. O efeito Verdoorn indica que a expans\~ao da demanda elevou o crescimento da produtividade do trabalho. Por sua vez, a produtividade n\~ao foi afetada diretamente pelo crescimento do sal\'ario real, de modo que o efeito Hicks-Marx foi nulo. O crescimento dos sal\'arios foi fundamental para a expans\~ao da demanda. Contudo, n\~ao houve uma mudan\c{c}a estrutural robusta. Os setores que mais contribu\'iram para o crescimento dos sal\'arios, produto e emprego foram \`aqueles com os menores n\'iveis de produtividade do trabalho. Por isso, o aumento da demanda e sal\'arios pouco afetou o crescimento da produtividade, embora tenha elevado \`a parcela salarial, reduzido a desigualdade salarial e gerado significativo volume de emprego. O crescimento econ\^omico elevado e sustentado com redistribui\c{c}\~ao de renda requer uma mudan\c{c}a estrutural na economia para deslocar o emprego e aumentar o investimento em dire\c{c}\~ao \`as atividades com retornos crescentes, como o setor manufatureiro inovador},

In the different strands of financialization literature, housing either plays a minor role or is simply seen as one of the bearers of financialization. The relations between housing and financialization are under-researched and under-theorized. This article, first, looks at the rise of housing finance as an integral part of macro-economic policy, and second, at the role of financial globalization in the rise of housing finance. Housing is seen as an absorber of a `wall of money', but the absorption of finance by housing is a very uneven process. Four trajectories of national institutional structures are suggested, and it is discussed how capital flows are absorbed in each of these trajectories. Finally, it is discussed what this tells about the geographies of financialized capitalism, and its relations to debt, housing, mortgage markets and the spatial fix.},

We focus on semiparametric models with unobserved individual and time effects, where the distribution of the outcome variable conditional on covariates and unobserved effects is specified parametrically, while the distribution of the unobserved effects is left unrestricted. Compared to existing reviews on long panels (Arellano and Hahn 2007; a section in Arellano and Bonhomme 2011) we discuss models with both individual and time effects, split-panel Jackknife bias corrections, unbalanced panels, distribution and quantile effects, and other extensions. Understanding and correcting the incidental parameter bias caused by the estimation of many fixed effects is our main focus, and the unifying theme is that the order of this bias is given by the simple formula p/n for all models discussed, with p the number of estimated parameters and n the total sample size.},

  abstract = {The 2007 sub-prime crisis in the United States, prolonged by a severe economic recession spread over many countries around the world, has led many researchers to focus on the recent fluctuations in housing prices and their relationships with macroeconomics and monetary policies. The existence of common housing cycles among the countries of the euro zone could lead the European Central Bank to integrate more specifically the evolution of such asset prices in its assessment. In this paper, we implement a multivariate unobserved component model on housing market variables in order to assess the common euro area housing cycle and to evaluate its relationship with the economic cycle. Among the general class of multivariate unobserved component models, we implement the band-pass filter based on the trend plus cycle decomposition model and we allow the existence of two cycles of different periods. The dataset consists of gross domestic product and real house prices series for four main euro area countries (Germany, France, Italy and Spain). Empirical results show a strong relationship for business cycles in France, Italy and Spain. Moreover, French and Spanish house prices cycles appear to be strongly related, while the German one possesses its own dynamics. Finally, we find that GDP and house prices cycles are related in the medium-term for fluctuations between 4 and 8 years, while the housing market contributes to the long-termeconomic growth only in Spain and Germany},

In a first part, we empirically show that cycles in the housing sector, measured by housing prices, housing starts, building permits, sales or residential investment, are strongly correlated to GDP cycles with a lead lying between of one and four quarters, suggesting thus that a monitoring of housing fluctuations could bring useful information for macroeconomic forecasting. Interestingly, this result is robust to the various considered approaches. Moreover, it seems that the housing sector long-term trend possesses its own dynamics, quite different from the aggregate French economic activity. Thus, in a second part, we review various structural factors that could drive housing market developments in France in the future.},

  abstract = {{$<$}section class="abstract"{$><$}p{$>$}As is well known, the closure of the canonical Neo-Kaleckian model is an endogenous rate of capacity utilisation. To allay concerns of Harrodian instability one response has been to endogenise the normal rate to effective demand pressures. Recent contributions have stressed microfoundations for an adjustment in the normal rate towards the actual rate. The new approach focuses on shiftwork and redefines capacity utilisation as the average workweek of capital. This paper examines whether the new concept of capacity utilisation can provide a firmer basis for endogeneity in the normal rate. It argues that the assumption of variability in the normal shift system cannot be generalised across manufacturing industries, while the potential relevance for non-manufacturing industries is unknown. Another concern is that long-run trends in the average workweek of capital and aggregate demand do not coincide. The paper also finds that the long-run trend in the US Federal Reserve's index of capacity utilisation for the manufacturing sector is not flat as frequently claimed. Instead, there is a downward trend from the mid 1960s, which matches the slowdown in aggregate demand.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {This paper reviews various interpretations of the nature and effects of financialization, suggesting that finance has expanded disproportionately, with correspondingly negative effects on the volume and the efficiency of capital accumulation and causing dysfunction in economic and social reproduction, accordingly as finance incorporates a wider range of economic and social activities. This is important in order to understand the relatively slow growth since the end of the post-war boom and the causes and course of the current crisis. The close relationship between financialization and neoliberalism is emphasised, the latter having gone through a shock phase (of state intervention intended to promote private capital in general and finance in particular), followed by further intervention to sustain financialization and respond to its dysfunctions. Consequently, it is important to distinguish between the often inconsistent and shifting incidence of scholarship, ideology and policy in practice that characterises neoliberalism. Alternative strategies will need to go beyond financialization to the material conditions of production and reproduction themselves.},

On the one hand, the study of multiple configurational causal relations allows researchers to deal with the extremely complex set of elements that interact in policy processes. However, this task poses the challenge of balancing deductive and inductive logics in a research design. On the other hand, policy process theories often involve temporal arguments, but QCA does not easily deal with dynamic elements. This article discusses these challenges and proposes several ways to address them. It thereby illustrates the advantages and limitations of QCA for students of policy processes.},

However, institutional mechanisms keep such drivers in check, and prompt a stop-and-go cycle as Kalecki suggested in his landmark 1943 paper. We find that the push of labor interests against business stakeholders leads to nonlinear dynamics over debt and deficits and creates uncertainty over long-term growth path.},

  abstract = {Sociologists conceptualize lifestyles as structured hierarchically where people seek to emulate those higher up. Growing income inequality in the United States means those at the top bid up the price of valued goods like housing and those in lower groups have struggled to maintain their relative positions. We explore this process in the context of the U.S. housing market from 1999 to 2007 by analyzing over 4,000 residential moves from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Houses are the ultimate status symbol. Their size, quality, and location signal to others that one has (or has not) arrived. We show that in areas where income inequality was higher, all movers went deeper into debt and increased their monthly housing costs to live in more desirable neighborhoods. But because people at the top of the income distribution had so much more money, they were able to take on less debt to keep their position in the status queue. Everyone below them who made a move to buy a house took on more debt, particularly in areas with higher income inequality. This evidence suggests that growing inequality implies that those at the top buy the best homes while others struggle to keep pace amid rising housing costs.},

Regional myocardial blood flow was determined by means of the particle distribution method. In normoxia a transmural gradient of flow was observed, with the subendocardial layers receiving a significantly higher flow rate compared with the subepicardial layers. In hypoxia induced vasodilation this transmural gradient of flow was persistent. In contrast a marked redistribution of regional flow was observed under pharmacologically induced vasodilation. The transmural gradient decreased. In contrast to some findings these experiments demonstrate that a considerable vasodilatory capacity exists in all layers of the myocardium and can be utilized by drugs. The differences observed for the intramural distribution pattern of flow under hypoxia and drug induced vasodilation support the hypothesis that this pattern reflects corresponding gradients of regional myocardial metabolism.},

  abstract = {The possibility that movements in prices could be due to the self-fulfilling prophecies of market participants has long intrigued observers of free markets. This paper surveys the current state of the empirically-oriented literature concerning rational dynamic indeterminacies, by which we mean a situation of self-fulfilling prophecy within a rational expectations model. Empirical work in this area concentrates primarily on indeterminacies in price levels, exchange rates, and equity prices. We first examine a particular type of explosive indeterminacy, usually called a rational bubble, in an example of the market for equities. Then, we consider empirical work relating to price-level and exchange-rate indeterminacies and empirical studies of indeterminacies in stock prices. Finally, we take up some interpretive issues.},

  abstract = {The reallocation of mortgage debt to low-income or marginally qualified borrowers plays a central role in many explanations of the early 2000s housing boom. We show that such a reallocation never occurred, as the distribution of mortgage debt with respect to income changed little even as the aggregate stock of debt grew rapidly. Moreover, because mortgage debt varies positively with income in the cross section, equal percentage increases in debt among high- and low-income borrowers meant that wealthy borrowers accounted for most new debt in dollar terms. Previous research stressing the importance of low-income borrowing was based on the inflow of new mortgage originations alone, so it could not detect offsetting outflows in mortgage terminations that left the allocation of debt stable over time. And while defaults on subprime mortgages played an important part in the financial crisis, the data show that subprime lending did not cause a reallocation of debt toward the poor. Rather, subprime lending prevented a reallocation of debt toward the wealthy.},

Reformulating their discrete-time model in a way that makes the length of the adjustment period explicit, it aks whether two elementary postulates of a sound modelling are satisfied: (a) A model should also remain well-defined when the adjustment period shrinks to zero; (b) The main qualitative dynamic properties should not essentially be affected by the choice of the adjustment period. It is found that postulate (a) is fulfilled but, regarding the presence of cyclical dynamics, postulate (b) is violated. In addition, the stability condition in the continuous-time version has an unsatisfactory economic implication. On the other hand, a rival supermultiplier model (specified along the lines proposed by, in particular, Allain and Lavoie) is spared from these problems. This suggests that the problem in SFB is caused by too strong an accelerator mechanism.},

Invoking a strategic complementarity, desired utilization is thus an increasing function of not only the profit share but also the actual utilization. Drawing on recent empirical material and a straightforward functional specification, the model is subsequently numerically calibrated. In particular, this ensures a unique solution for a steady-state position in which the actual and the endogenous desired rates of utilization coincide. On the other hand, it turns out that the anticipated losses of firms by not producing at the desired level are rather small. Hence there may be only weak pressure on them to close a utilization gap in the ordinary way by suitable adjustments in fixed investment. It is indicated that this finding may serve Kaleckian economists as a more rigorous justification for viewing their equilibria as pertaining to the long run, even if they allow actual utilization to deviate persistently from desired utilization.},

We show that the main results of the long-period and fully adjusted versions of the model in terms of growth rate and level effects are quite similar and therefore that such results in no way require the full adjustment of capacity to demand. We then analyze a simple set of sufficient dynamic local stability conditions that allow the long-period positions to gravitate towards the fully adjusted position in which capacity is adjusted to demand and that also provide the upper limit to demand-led growth paths. Finally, we show how some critics of the model have misinterpreted it as being supply-led and how this has led to a further confusion between the analysis of the tendency towards a constant value of the capacity-saving-determined warranted rate of growth and the proper stability analysis of the opposite process of adjusting capacity to demand (which tends to adjust the warranted rate endogenously to the growth rate of autonomous demand).},

  abstract = {Households and banks have increasingly displaced non-financial businesses and governments as the primary debtors in modern capitalist economies, resulting in more severe economic cycles, increased inequality, and external macroeconomic imbalances. Yet while the trend is nearly universal among developed economies, its intensity varies a great deal from country to country. This article highlights (1) the common international causes behind the global expansion of household and financial sector debt; (2) the divergent national approaches to household credit that cause household and financial sector indebtedness to vary from country to country; and (3) the likely causes of these disparate approaches. National approaches to interest rate restrictions, property transfer taxation, high loan-to-value (LTV) mortgages, mortgage interest taxation, and secondary markets for consumer debt can either encourage or mitigate household and financial sector borrowing. Whether a country encourages or mitigates such credit is determined by an idiosyncratic mix of institutional, political, and ideational factors. Especially important are the size of domestic pension funds, banks' preferred business models, the political power of financial firms, and whether policymakers are more sensitive to the gains promised by a credit-fueled expansion or to the risks posed by an overleveraged collapse.},

However, the study of wealth, which is more unequally distributed than income, has been largely understudied within CPE. Using new data from the World Income Database (WID), this article examines how economic, political and institutional dynamics shape wealth-to-income ratios within Western European and OECD countries. It is found that the political and institutional determinants that affect income inequality have no short- or long-run effects on the wealth-to-income ratio. Rather, the rise in wealth-to-income ratios is driven by rising housing prices, as well as price changes in other financial assets, not home ownership or national saving rates. The article concludes by examining how the changing dynamics of housing prices and wealth inequality will increasingly shape intergenerational \textendash{} and associated class-based \textendash{} political conflict in Western Europe.},

The paper illustrates and quantifies how housing policies can make a difference. Removing mortgage interest relief eases price pressures and can contribute to more affordable housing. Likewise, streamlining land-use governance and easing rental control can help unlock housing supply, make housing markets more efficient and, ultimately, housing more affordable.},

Paradoxically, the fuzzy set is a powerful tool because it replaces an unwieldy, "fuzzy" instrument\textemdash the variable, which establishes only the positions of cases relative to each other, with a precise one\textemdash degree of membership in a well-defined set.Ragin argues that fuzzy sets allow a far richer dialogue between ideas and evidence in social research than previously possible. They let quantitative researchers abandon "homogenizing assumptions" about cases and causes, they extend diversity-oriented research strategies, and they provide a powerful connection between theory and data analysis. Most important, fuzzy sets can be carefully tailored to fit evolving theoretical concepts, sharpening quantitative tools with in-depth knowledge gained through qualitative, case-oriented inquiry. This book will revolutionize research methods not only in sociology, political science, and anthropology but in any field of inquiry dealing with complex patterns of causation.},

Although both models' empirical predictions in the short-run are confirmed, our results reject the baseline Neo-Kaleckian model in favor of the Sraffian Supermultiplier in the long-run .},

Nonetheless, the evidence in Spain shows that the deterioration of lending policies may not be fully captured by the popular loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Drawing on two large datasets comprising more than five million mortgage operations that cover the last financial cycle, we show that the LTV indicator may exhibit a misleading picture of actual mortgage credit imbalances and risk. In turn, risk identification improves when other metrics are considered. In particular, we show that loan-to-price (LTP) as well as ratios that consider the income of borrowers are major determinants of mortgage defaults. Moreover, we identify relevant non-linear effects of lending standards on default risk. Finally, we document that the relationship between lending standards and default rates changes over the cycle. Overall, the findings provide useful insights for the design of the macroprudential policy mix and, in particular, for the implementation of borrower-based measures.},

I use panel-data tests for cointegration that are more powerful than their time-series counterparts to test for cointegration in a panel of 95 metro areas over 23 years. Using a bootstrap approach to allow for cross-correlations in city-level house-price shocks, I show that even these more powerful tests do not reject the hypothesis of no cointegration.

In economics the industrial dynamics approach makes use of simulation techniques to understand the complexity of the industrial process of continuous change.

In this paper, we study ``History-friendly'' analyses and counterfactuals. Some examples of ``History-friendly'' models are widely examined. Finally, the paper makes a critical contribution to ``History-friendly'' methodology and defines the role of ``History-friendly'' models in the debate on the empirical validation of simulations.},

  abstract = {Before economists relegate a speculative event to the inexplicable or bubble category, we must exhaust all reasonable economic explanations. Among the "reasonable" or "market fundamental" explanations I would include the perception of an increased probability of large returns. The perception might be triggered by genuine economic good news, by a convincing new economic theory about payoffs, or by a fraud launched by insiders acting strategically to trick investors. It might also be triggered by uninformed market participants correctly inferring changes in the distribution of dividends by observing price movements generated by the trading of informed insiders. While some of these perceptions might in the end prove erroneous, movements in asset prices based on them are fundamental and not bubble movements. I aim in these pages to propose market fundamental explanations for the three most famous bubbles: the Dutch tulipmania (1634-37), the Mississippi Bubble (1719-20), and the closely connected South Sea Bubble (1720). Though several authors have proposed market fundamental explanations for the well-documented Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles, these episodes are still treated in the modern literature as outbursts of irrationality.},

  abstract = {Previous research about the effects of board structure and process on the firm financial performance is based on conflicting theoretical perspectives, and empirical results, mostly based on regression analysis, are inconclusive. Building from complexity theory and configurational analysis, this study offers clarity to inconclusive previous empirical results about the link among several board features and firm financial performance. From a sample of 295 non-financial firms from Southern Europe for the period 2001-2010, and by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, findings of this study show that firm financial performance depends on a complex configuration of several board features (board size, board independence, leadership structure and board activity) and several corporate characteristics (firm size, firm leverage and firm age). This paper has implications for academics. Despite different theoretical arguments and inconclusive results of the wide empirical literature addressing the effect of board characteristics on the firm performance, building from complexity theory this paper adds to our knowledge because it empirically explores under which circumstances different board features should contribute positively or negatively to firm performance. The results of this study have also implications for policy makers and practitioners by providing some useful hints to the controversial relationship between corporate governance and financial performance. In this sense, general corporate governance recommendations must be rethought.},

It shows that given two simple hypotheses, the economy will exhibit a tendency to grow independently of any increase in the average level of ongoing investment (or any other type of `autonomous' demand) over time. The two hypotheses are (a) that investment oscillates over time and (b) that the community's marginal propensity to consume is lower when income contracts in slumps than when it increases in booms. This points to a source of growth that is as endogenous to the system, as trade cycles are.},

  abstract = {This paper tracks the history of government intervention in the U.S. mortgage market between 1932 and the 1960s, a period in which the system for housing finance underwent a fundamental transformation. Whereas prior to 1930 the government had little involvement in the mortgage market, by the 1960s it was a major player. These interventions were triggered in part by economic crises, particularly the Great Depression. Yet, as I argue in this paper, they were also motivated by a cultural understanding of homeownership as central to American identity and the rise of housing policy as a substitute for other forms of social assistance. Many of the instruments established during these years to direct the flow of credit toward housing would emerge as central features of the housing market that persist to the present day. These policies mark the beginning of the permanent subsidisation of residential mortgage credit. In addition, beyond introducing long-term debt instruments to the consumer, they fostered the depersonalisation of credit relations. In this way, I also show that some of the weaknesses that have contributed to current U.S. housing market woes found their inception in the policy responses to the Great Depression.},

The first example demonstrates how branching statements with floating point operands of comparison operators create a high degree of nonlinearity, leading in this case to the creation of 'ghost' agents -- visible to some parts of the program but not to others. A potential solution to this problem is proposed. The second example shows how mathematical descriptions of models in the literature are insufficient to enable exact replication of work since mathematically equivalent implementations in terms of real number arithmetic are not equivalent in terms of floating point arithmetic.},

  abstract = {{$<$}section class="abstract"{$><$}p{$>$}This paper looks at the effect of demand shocks on the investment share of the economy. Using panel data on 20 OECD countries, we show that the rate of growth of autonomous demand (exports, public spending, and housing investment) is positively correlated with subsequent values of the share of business investment in GDP. By means of an instrumental-variables (IV) strategy, we confirm a positive effect of demand dynamics on the business investment share. We instrument autonomous demand with (i) US demand for imports interacted with exposure to trade with the US, (ii) openness to trade of a country's main export destinations, and (iii) military spending. A permanent 1-percentage-point increase in autonomous-demand growth raises the investment share by 1.5 to 1.9 percentage points of GDP in our preferred panel IV specification. Our results provide empirical support for the view that the influence of aggregate demand on capital accumulation can be a major source of hysteresis. Our results are inconsistent with the canonical New Keynesian three-equations model, the Neo-Kaleckian model with flexible equilibrium utilization, and Classical\textendash Marxian growth models. A positive influence of autonomous demand on the investment share is instead compatible with demand-led models in which capacity adjusts to demand in the long run.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {According to the Sraffian supermultiplier model, economic growth is driven by the autonomous components of aggregate demand (exports, public spending and autonomous consumption). This paper tests empirically some major implications of the model. For this purpose, we calculate time-series of the autonomous components of aggregate demand and of the supermultiplier for the US, France, Germany, Italy and Spain and describe their patterns in recent decades. We observe that changes in output and in autonomous demand are tightly correlated, both in the long and in the short-run. The supermultiplier is substantially higher and more stable in the US, while in the European countries it is lower and strongly decreasing. Consistently with theory, we find that where the supermultiplier is reasonably stable - i.e., in the US since the 1960s - autonomous demand and output share a common long-run trend (i.e, they are cointegrated). The estimation of a Vector Error-Correction model (VECM) on US data suggests that autonomous demand exerts a long-run effect on GDP, but also that there is simultaneous causality between the two variables. We propose an explanation based on the idea that autonomous demand is socially and historically determined. We then estimate the multiplier of autonomous spending through a panel instrumental-variables approach, finding that a one dollar increase in autonomous demand raises output by 1.6 dollars over four years. A further implication of the model that we test against empirical evidence is that increases in autonomous demand growth tend to be followed by increases in the investment share. Through Granger-causality tests and instrumental variables analysis, we find that this is the case in all five countries. An additional 1\% increase in autonomous demand raises the investment share by 0.57 percentage points of GDP in the long-run},

  abstract = {This paper looks at the effect of demand shocks on the investment share of the economy. Using panel data on 20 OECD countries, we show that the rate of growth of autonomous demand (exports, public spending and housing investment) is positively correlated with subsequent values of the share of business investment in GDP. By means of an instrumental-variables strategy, we confirm a positive effect of demand dynamics on the business investment share. We instrument autonomous demand with US demand for imports interacted with exposure to trade with the US, openness to trade of a country's main export destinations, and military spending. A permanent 1\% increase in autonomous demand growth raises the investment share by 1.5 to 1.9 percentage points of GDP in our preferred panel IV specification. Our results provide empirical support for the view that the influence of aggregate demand on capital accumulation can be a major source of hysteresis. Our results are inconsistent with the canonical New Keynesian 3-equations model, the Neo-Kaleckian model with flexible equilibrium utilization and Classical-Marxian growth models. A positive influence of autonomous demand on the investment share is instead compatible with demand-led models in which capacity adjusts to demand in the long-run.},

Some recent contributions revive an old proposal for solving this problem \textendash{} making the normal rate of utilization an endogenous variable that converges to the actual utilization rate \textendash{} justifying it with new, micro-founded premises. We argue that these new justifications for the convergence of normal to actual utilization do not stand closer scrutiny. First, the proposed microeconomic model relies on various restrictive assumptions, some of which are mutually inconsistent. Second, the derivation of the macroeconomic adjustment mechanism from the microeconomic analysis involves a logical leap, that can be justified only by a very arbitrary assumption with little economic justification. Finally, we discuss the way in which this mechanism has been incorporated into the Neo-Kaleckian growth model by proposers of this approach. We show that, even if one puts aside, for the sake of argument, the first two points, the existence of autonomous components of demand is sufficient to invalidate the resulting macroeconomic model.},

  abstract = {How do inequality and growth evolve in the long run and why? We address this question by analyzing the interplay between household debt, growth and inequality within a monetary, stock-flow consistent framework. We first consider a Goodwin\textendash Keen model where household consumption, rather than investment by firms, is the key behavioural driver for the dynamics of the economy. Whenever consumption exceeds current income, households can borrow from the banking sector. The resulting three dimensional dynamical system for wage share, employment rate, and household debt exhibits the characteristic asymptotic equilibria of the original Keen model, namely the analogue of Solow's balanced-growth path, where all state variables converge to an interior point, in addition to deflationary equilibria with explosive debt and collapsing employment. We then extend this set-up by separating the household sector into workers and investors, obtaining a four-dimensional system with analogous types of asymptotic behaviour. Our main result is that long-run increasing inequality between these two classes of households occurs if and only if the system approaches one of the equilibria with unbounded debt ratios. More specifically, we find that one essential channel of increased inequality is the wealth transfer from workers to investors due to interest paid on debt from the former to the latter. Finally, when properly rewritten, the celebrated inequality r {$>$} g turns out to be a necessary condition for the asymptotic stability of long-run debt-deflation. Our findings shed new light on the relationships between fairness and efficiency, and have implications for public economic policy.},

Because of the important role housing wealth has been playing during the current upswing, this paper will look more closely at what is underlying these developments for 18 OECD countries over the period from 1970 to the present, with a view to shedding some light on whether or not prices are in line with fundamentals. The paper begins by putting the most recent housing price run-ups in the context of the experiences of the past 35 years. It then examines current valuations against a range of benchmarks. It concludes with a review of the links between a possible correction of housing prices and real activity. The main highlights from this analysis are as follows: 1) The size and duration of the current real house price increases; the degree to which they have tended to move together across countries; and the extent to which they have disconnected from the business cycle are unprecedented. 2) Overvaluation of real house prices may only apply to a relatively small number of countries. However, the extent to which these prices look to be fairly valued depends largely on longer-term interest rates remaining at or close to their current low levels. 3) If house prices were to adjust downward, the historical record suggests that the drops might be large and that the process could be protracted, given the observed stickiness of nominal house prices and the current low rates of inflation.},

We explain why growth at Harrod's warranted rate is fundamentally or statically unstable.

The expansion has been generated by economic processes that are unsustainable--processes in private saving, private borrowing, and asset prices that have fueled the growth of demand against a negative impetus both from fiscal policy and from net export demand. Given unchanged fiscal policy and the consensus forecast for growth in the rest of the world, continued expansion requires that private expenditure continue to expand relative to income on a record and growing scale, and it seems impossible that this source of growth can be forthcoming indefinitely, although it may well continue into next year. When private demand falters, it will be necessary to bring about a substantial relaxation of fiscal policy and to ensure that there is a structural improvement in the United States's balance of payments.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a stylized short-run neo-Kaleckian model incorporating personal income inequality and income taxes based on You and Dutt (1996), targeting a gap in the post-Keynesian literature. Accordingly, the main goal of this paper is to investigate how changes in income taxes and personal income distribution affect output growth in the stylized model. The theoretical discussion of the model is then empirically assessed using data retrieved from the Survey of Household Income and Wealth published by the Bank of Italy. The empirical analysis confirms both the heterogeneity of the propensities to consume of Italian households, as well as validates the dominance of absolute income effects in the Italian consumer behaviour that assures the negative trade-off between inequality and aggregate demand. More specifically, it is shown that, overall, Italians are still incomebudget constrained, preventing from a compensation of the demand-depressing effects of raising inequality via debt and wealth-based consumption. Likewise, it is argued that decreasing personal income inequality via progressive income tax reforms and through a shift towards wages would have positive effects on aggregate demand, utilization and growth, further boosting the effect of government expenditure (through its impact on the multiplier).},

  abstract = {This paper develops an amended version of the Sraffian Supermultiplier Model incorporating personal income inequality and income taxes to cover an existing gap in the literature. It is demonstrated that a progressive tax shift would engender temporary higher growth rates (during the traverse) and an overall positive level effect. Furthermore, the size of this impact is associated to the product of the propensity to consume and the income share of each income bracket. Secondly, financial features and real estate prices are incorporated in autonomous consumption. Shifts in the financial parameters, as well as the sustainability of autonomous consumption-led growth are discussed, together with the policy conditions that lead to sustainable growth strategies. In this sense, two issues are highlighted. First, the growth of debt-financed consumption has to move in step rather than detached from income distribution, with debt being stopped from replacing systematically disposable income (leading both to higher levels of output as well as to a more stable multiplier). Second, it is argued that an analysis of growth contributions is of chief importance in terms of policy design and implementation, thus preventing the supremacy of autonomous consumption over other components autonomous demand.},

Goldsmith has combined his experience, good sense, and flair with figures to construct this groundbreaking comparative study of the balance sheets of twenty of the largest nations.

The majority of the balance sheets were created especially for this project, their components gleaned from fragmentary and heterogeneous data. There are approximately 3,500 entries, each measuring the value of one type of tangible or financial asset or liability at a given date. Goldsmith's estimates are keyed to fifteen benchmark dates in the economic progress of the cited nations, and for twelve nations he was able to construct balance sheets dating back to the nineteenth century or earlier. Combined, worldwide balance sheet are included for 1950 and 1978. Comparative National Balance Sheets will provide an essential basis for the quantitative analysis of the long-term financial development of these nations. In addition to national balance sheets for all large countries except Brazil and China, sectoral balance sheets for France, Germany, Great Britain, India, Japan, and the United States in the postwar period are also included.},

  abstract = {The neo-Kaleckian theoretical framework focuses on the importance of effective demand in the income generation process in order to relate its functional distribution \textendash{} share of income that goes to wage and profits \textendash{} to economic growth, and thus characterize the demand regime that leads it, either wage-led (wage share positively affecting growth) or profit led (profit share positively affecting growth). Recent contributions include extensions to the standard model such as open economy effects, family credit, and personal distribution of income to further characterize the regime type. Based on that approach, this paper aims to empirically analyze the performance of the Brazilian economy between 1995 and 2015 in order to identify the relationship between functional distribution of income and aggregate demand. The idea is to test whether variables that are not present in the seminal model that seem to affect the brazillian economy in the 2000s \textendash{} such as consumer credit, personal distribution of income, commodity prices and the share of service sector on GDP \textendash{} alter the relationship between the two variables. Our results suggest that the control for those aspects indeed change the intercept and inclination of our demmand and distributive curves.},

  abstract = {Interconnected capital markets allow mobile global capital to flow into immobile local assets. This paper examines how foreign demand affects U.S. housing markets, and uses this demand shock to estimate local price elasticities of supply. Other countries introduced foreign-buyer taxes meant to deter Chinese housing investment beginning in 2011. We first show house prices grew 8 percentage points more in U.S. zipcodes with high foreign-born Chinese populations after 2011, subsequently reversing with the onset of the U.S.\textendash China trade war. Second, we use international tax policy changes as a U.S. housing demand shock and estimate local house price and quantity elasticities with respect to international capital. We find that a 1\% increase in instrumented foreign capital raises house prices at the zip code level by 0.27\%, and housing supply by 0.004\%. Finally, we use the two elasticities to construct new local house price elasticities of supply for the largest 100 CBSAs. These supply elasticities average 0.1 and vary between 0.02 and 0.7, suggesting that local housing markets are inelastic in the short run and exhibit substantial spatial heterogeneity.},

Building upon a considerable library of research on fund returns, the study uses fsQCA to affirm and extend earlier discoveries. Considered here is fund performance relative to Morningstar ratings, features of the funds themselves, as well as characteristics of the fund managers. Results suggest that positive Morningstar and analyst ratings are necessary conditions, on average, for funds to generate value according to the Jensen's alpha ratio. Just over seven percent of the cases imply that funds have attractive Sharpe ratios and higher returns when the funds have lower management fees and lower ongoing fees. Likewise, larger funds with better Morningstar ratings are associated with improved Sharpe ratios and better returns, often where the fund manager has not been managing the fund for a long period.},

It maintains that the needed science is a chemistry of                 organization, addressing the combination of 'organizational elements' playing a role                 analogous to that of chemical elements in composing a variety of substances. Drawing                 both on classic organization design theory and on configurational and                 complementarity-based approaches, the paper specifies a set of basic organizational                 elements and a set of combinatory laws regulating their effective combinations.                 Testable propositions are derived on the necessary and sufficient conditions that                 the composition of organizations should have respect for achieving high levels of                 efficiency and innovation. These propositions are tested empirically on a sample of                 firms, using an innovative application of Boolean algebra.},

The authors compare the form of U.S. home mortgages today with those in other countries. The U.S. mortgage provides many more options to borrowers than are commonly provided elsewhere: American homebuyers can choose whether to pay a fixed or floating rate of interest; they can lock in their interest rate in between the time they apply for the mortgage and the time they purchase their house; they can choose the time at which the mortgage rate resets; they can choose the term and the amortization period; they can prepay freely; and they can generally borrow against home equity freely. They can also obtain home mortgages at attractive terms with very low down payments. The authors discuss the nature of the U.S. government intervention in home mortgage markets that has led to the specific choices available to American homebuyers. They believe that the unique characteristics of the U.S. mortgage provide substantial benefits for American homeowners and the overall stability of the economy.},

Housing finance systems have evolved differently across countries, although there are elements in common. The chapter addresses these questions: What accounts for these cross-country differences in the structure of housing finance; Is there a process of convergence in structure; and how have these changes affected housing affordability. It presents an international perspective fleshed out with three contrasting case studies. The chapter considers what the implications are for supervisory policies or financial market regulation. A variety of indicators imply that the housing finance revolution in the USA has improved efficiency and consumer welfare. Controlled Vocabulary Terms Finance; housing},

Thus, housing leads and other types of investment lag the business cycle. The results also suggest that policies designed to funnel capital away from housing into plant and equipment could produce severe short-run dislocations.

  abstract = {The US financial services industry grew from 4.9 percent of GDP in 1980 to 7.9 percent of GDP in 2007. A sizeable portion of the growth can be explained by rising asset management fees, which in turn were driven by increases in the valuation of tradable assets, particularly equity. Another important factor was growth in fees associated with an expansion in household credit, particularly fees associated with residential mortgages. This expansion was fueled by the development of nonbank credit intermediation (or "shadow banking"). We offer a preliminary assessment of whether the growth of active asset management, household credit, and shadow banking -- the main areas of growth in the financial sector -- has been socially beneficial.},

We provide a unified framework to examine four excess credit supply variables and three speculation variables that have been proposed in the literature. Credit supply variables, particularly subprime share and worse originator share, strongly relate to future zip code level house price changes in the boom and bust, whereas none of the speculation variables consistently relate to house prices within MSAs. Pre-trends, supply elasticity, and depressed areas suggest these relations are not driven by lenders anticipating house price growth.},

To this purpose, we estimate an error-correction model for US consumption, accounting for the role of household debt flows before and after the crisis. Contrary to an analysis carried out in terms of net wealth, a decomposition of households' assets and liabilities shows how the pre-crisis period was characterized by an excessive indebtedness, which was both a source of short-term growth and of financial instability. In the current ``new normal'' situation, private consumption cannot rely on debt flows as much as before the crisis. This is, therefore, an important ``demand-side'' explanation for the much-debated low growth recovery.},

We show analytically that house prices grow in the long term if i) the housing sector is more land-intensive than the non-housing sector, or ii) technological progress in the construction sector is weaker than in the non-housing sector. The model is calibrated separately to the US, UK, France, and Germany. Quantitatively, both channels are equally relevant for rising house prices. We then study the dynamics in the housing wealth-to-income ratio by computing transitions. The model replicates on average 89 percent of the observed increase in the housing wealth-to-income ratio. The key for replicating the data is the differentiation between residential land as a non-reproducible factor and residential structure as a reproducible factor.},

There is a large growing literature exploring two different approaches: on the one hand, a boom\textendash bust in house prices can generate a boom\textendash bust in credit market and, on the other hand, a boom\textendash bust in credit markets can generate a boom\textendash bust in house prices. We start by presenting a stark mechanical model to formalize the interaction between housing prices and credit markets and explore these two channels in a mechanical way. Next, we present two simple models that highlight the two approaches. First, we propose a catastrophe model, where an increase in credit availability can generate first a boom and then a bust in mortgage markets because of multiple equilibria due to adverse selection: as lending expands, the composition of borrowers worsens and at some point this can generate a crash in credit market. Second, we propose a sentiment model, where house prices increase above fundamentals because investors buy assets under the irrational belief that there is always going to be an ever more foolish buyer, willing to buy at a higher price. In the course of the chapter, we relate our simple models to the large existing literature on these topics. At the end, we also point to some empirical papers that propose related facts.},

Trade-centred approaches highlight the role of cost competitiveness, in particular unit labour costs, and aggregate demand. In contrast, finance-centred approaches focus on gross financial flows, driven by expectations and the return on assets, that impact demand and the exchange rate. This article, first, builds a simple model of the current account that provides a synthesis between the two approaches. Unit labour costs impact the current account via the real exchange rate and income distribution, while financial inflows drive up asset prices, which leads to nominal appreciation and an increase in domestic demand. Second, we estimate a reduced form of this model for 28 OECD countries from 1972 to 2014, controlling for both trade- and finance-centred channels and a wide range of control variables. Our results indicate that finance-centred channels, via equity and residential property prices, drove current account divergence in the OECD, while unit labour costs were less important. They suggest that the effects of gross financial flows deserve more attention in theoretical and empirical models of the current account.},

We also show that under the weak instrument approximation conventional GMM estimators are dominated in terms of mean squared error by an estimator with far less moment conditions. The long difference (LD) estimator mimics the infeasible optimal procedure through its reliance on a small set of moment conditions.},

  abstract = {In organizational research the object of study is often a process, that is, a complex of events and activities that unfolds over time. In this chapter we focus on temporally ordered configurations, which can be defined as those configurations in which conditions occur in a specific temporal order. We illustrate the aims, characteristics, and limitations of several approaches that have been proposed as tools for the analysis of temporal order. Our illustration involves an analysis of the ``gestation activities'' of nascent entrepreneurs, that is, persons involved in the creation of a new firm. We aim to identify temporal sequences of gestation activities that generate or allow a successful outcome of the gestation process, while an occurrence of the same activities in another temporal order will not generate or allow that outcome. First we discuss Event Structure Analysis and Optimal Matching and conclude that these approaches cannot provide the kind of analysis that we are aiming at in this chapter. Then we discuss Temporal Qualitative Comparative Analysis, for which our analysis points to technical limitations that constrain its application. We then present and discuss an alternative approach, Temporal Necessary Condition Analysis.},

By evaluating the relationship between the propensity to invest and the rate of growth of demand for the case of the United States economy in the period from 1985 to 2017, our results provide empirical support for this relation, showing that movements in the output growth rate cause the movements in the induced investment ratio. Other significant result shows that the induced investment share presents a high degree of inertia from on period to another, while the effect of the lagged rate of growth of demand is low but statistically significant, suggesting a tendency for utilization to converge towards some exogenous normal level slowly. This feature, together with other estimated parameters of the model, suggest that the Sraffian Supermultiplier adjustment mechanism has been dynamically stable for the US data in the period under analysis.},

  abstract = {The use of simulation modelling techniques by neo-Schumpeterian economists dates back to Nelson and Winter's 1982 book ``An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change'', and has rapidly expanded ever since. This paper considers the way in which successive generations of models have extended the boundaries of research (both with respect to the range of phenomena considered and the different dimensions of innovation that are considered), and while simultaneously introducing novel modelling techniques. At the same time, the paper will highlight the distinct set of features that have emerged in these neo-Schumpeterian models, and which set them apart from the models developed by other schools. In particular, they share a distinct view about the type of world in which real economic agents operate, and a invariably contain a generic set of algorithms. In addition to reviewing past models, the paper considers a number of pressing issues that remain unresolved and which modellers will need to address in future. Notable amongst these are the methodological relationship between empirical studies and simulation (e.g. `history friendly modelling'), the development of common standards for sensitivity analysis, and the need to further extend the boundaries of research in order to consider important aspects of innovation and technical change.},

  abstract = {Recent events suggest that the death of the business cycle has been exaggerated; the issue of how one learns about and monitors the business cycle remains centre stage. Advent of the Euro and the potential for tensions when sovereign nations subsume their monetary policy into a single response also makes monitoring the business cycle of particular interest for Euro area policy makers. In this paper we summarize recent research on three questions relating to cycles in economic activity --- how to extract cyclical information, how to analyse it, and how to enquire into what special difficulties might be encountered when using cyclical indicators. This survey focuses on our own research which we view as a formalization of some of the procedures developed by Burns and Mitchell at the NBER. However, defence of our position goes beyond continuity with the past and is based on the view that the way in which these investigators defined the business cycle is a very natural one that connects with the way policy makers and commentators discuss the cycle.},

It uses the neighborhood clusters of the American housing survey, standardized by metropolitan area income and household size, to explore income distribution within neighborhoods at a scale much smaller than the census tract (a representative sample of households or `kernels' and their 10 closest neighbors). Joint and conditional distributions portray neighbors' characteristics conditional on the kernel's housing tenure, race, and income. The paper documents both significant income mixing in the majority of US urban micro neighborhoods and the extent of income mixing within neighborhoods of concentrated poverty.},

  abstract = {Globalization is widely held to circumscribe the parameters of political and economic choice in contemporary Europe, just as it has come to circumscribe the parameters of debate on the future of European models of capitalism. Yet opinions on the question of convergence nonetheless vary markedly, with proponents of the hyperglobalization thesis pointing to a simple and inexorable process of neoliberal convergence while an increasingly influential school of neo-institutionalists point to a rather more complex process of `dual' or `co-convergence', reinforcing the distinctiveness of liberal and coordinated market economies. In both accounts, the exhibited pattern of convergence (dual or otherwise) is seen to be driven by globalization. In this paper I provide a theoretical and empirical critique of this important literature, challenging the contextualization of the question of convergence with respect to globalization which both perspectives share. I advance a distinctive variant of the new institutionalism which emphasizes: (i) the contingency of any process of convergence observed; (ii) the frequently political as opposed to economic nature of convergent tendencies; (iii) the counter-tendencies which might be mobilized to such tendencies; and (iv) the invariably far greater significance, in the establishment of common trajectories, of regional rather than genuinely global processes of integration. Though common trajectories are discernible within contemporary Europe, associated in particular with the institutional architecture of EMU and an accelerating process of European economic integration, they have been embraced more or less enthusiastically and at variable paces, leading not to convergent but to divergent outcomes.},

As Howell has recently observed, comparative political economy `has reached a moment of theoretical synthesis, similar to that which existed around the concept of neo-corporatism in the early 1980s, in which a series of discrete, incremental theoretical developments coalesced into a new theoretical paradigm' (2003a: 103). The rise to prominence of this new paradigm has been exceptionally rapid, aided greatly by the publication of Hall and Soskice's deeply influential edited collection, Varieties of Capitalism: The Institutional Foundations of Comparative Advantage and, in particular, their extensive theoretical introduction (2001). Yet, partly as a consequence of this, the VoC perspective has not given rise to as extensive a body of secondary literature \textemdash{} assessing and evaluating its core theoretical and substantive contributions \textemdash{} as have many far less influential perspectives (though see Blyth 2003; Goodin 2003; Howell 2003a; Watson 2003; and for a response to their critics Hall and Soskice 2003). A critical evaluation and assessment of this exceptionally influential body of literature is, then, long overdue and is a core aim of this book.},

Yet it is far from evident that it is true. In this article, I return to the varieties conjecture, assessing the degree to which the claim might be warranted. In the process, I argue for the importance of differentiating clearly between ideal types and real types and for the value of heeding Weber's advice about the dangers of confusing one for the other. I suggest that although capitalisms do not really come in varieties it is sometimes useful to proceed on the basis that they do, particularly if we think of such varieties as potentially dystopic. I suggest that such an acknowledgement is crucial in sensitizing us to the potential biases of varietal thinking, drawing out the implications for the positing of capitalist varieties in the period after the global financial crisis.},

  abstract = {Recent research has cast some doubt on the consistency of models that isolate Scandinavian countries as different to other nations in terms of egalitarian welfare states. For example, it has been argued that if occupational welfare polices have their contribution to national welfare better accounted for in comparative models, or if there is a focus on specific aspects of welfare coverage, then Scandinavian welfare states look less different to other European countries. Using case-based methods that try to balance the demand for generalizations and the qualitative integrity of the case, this research examines the specific case of income protection for the older population post-retirement, to see if Scandinavian countries emerge as consistently different when compared with other OECD nations. Scandinavia can be clearly identified in a separate cluster, but it is not alone and other countries also share its similarities. In particular, Scandinavia emerges in a cluster that provides more income replacement and protection for women. In part, this is reinforced by the high rate of labour participation by women in Scandinavian countries. However, there is little evidence of Scandinavian countries retaining noticeable differences and divergence in income protection policies for men.},

  abstract = {A The risk premium puzzle is even worse than previously reported if housing is also taken into consideration next to equity. While housing premia are only moderately smaller than equity premia, they are significantly less volatile and the Sharpe ratio of housing is significantly larger. Hence, three question arise: i) are existing approaches to explain the equity premium puzzle also capable of explaining even larger Sharpe ratios than previously required, ii) can return rates and volatilities of various assets be differentiated, and iii) can different Sharpe ratios between the two risky assets be matched. We analyze these questions, next to business cycle statistics, by including housing into seminal approaches to solve the risk premium puzzle in production economies. Non-disaster economies with habit formation, capital adjustment costs and limited factor mobility fail to generate a Sharpe ratio of housing of the empirically observed size and do not explain co-moving economic activity. A basic model with time-varying disaster risk can reproduce the large Sharpe ratio of housing. Moreover, the model can explain different means and volatilities of the risky assets, economic activity comoves and the model explains the volatility ratio of business investments, residential investments and house prices. However, the model does not allow to disentangle the Sharpe ratios of the risky assets and premia on equity remain too involatile.},

Whereas previous contributions have focussed on taming Harrodian instability, generated by the deviation of the goods market equilibrium rate of capacity utilization from a normal or target rate, we rather focus on the so-far neglected issues of deficit, debt, and distribution dynamics in such models. For this purpose, we treat the growth of government expenditures on goods and services, financed by credit creation, as the exogenous growth rate driving the system. We examine the long-run convergence of the system toward such a growth rate, analyze the related debt dynamics, and deal with stability and income distribution issues. Finally, we touch upon the economic and, in particular, fiscal policy implications of our model results.},

In a simple closed private one-good economy model, each theory is presented drawing on the relationship between the rate of profit and the rate of growth, as well as on the consideration of one major adjusting variable allowing for the convergence of the endogenous variables of the model to their equilibrium values. This allows for a systematic comparison of exogenous and endogenous variables, of the `logic' or the chain of causalities in each of the approaches, and of the generation of the long-run equilibrium positions of the system. It is finally shown that the post-Kaleckian model is able to cover many but not all of the results generated by the old neoclassical growth model, new neoclassical growth theories, classical\textendash Marxian distribution and growth approaches, and post-Keynesian Kaldor\textendash Robinson and Kalecki\textendash Steindl distribution and growth theories.},

The analysis is based on a demand-driven distribution and growth model for an open economy inspired by Bhaduri and Marglin, which allows for either profit- or wage-led growth. We find that growth in France, Germany, the UK and the USA has been wage-led, whereas Austria and the Netherlands have been profit-led. In the case of Austria a domestically wage-led economy changes to profit-led when including the effect of distribution on external trade.

Whereas previous contributions have focussed on taming Harrodian instability, generated by the deviation of the goods market equilibrium rate of capacity utilization from a normal or target rate, we rather focus on the so-far neglected issues of deficit, debt, and distribution dynamics in such models. For this purpose, we treat the growth of government expenditures on goods and services, financed by credit creation, as the exogenous growth rate driving the system. We examine the long-run convergence of the system toward such a growth rate, analyze the related debt dynamics, and deal with stability and income distribution issues. Finally, we touch upon the economic and, in particular, fiscal policy implications of our model results.},

In particular, we specify the conditions for long-run stability of the workers' debt-capital ratio. We thus identify the threshold for this ratio to turn unstable causing increasing financial fragility and finally financial crisis due to systemic stock-flow or stock-stock dynamics.},

  abstract = {We will provide a post-Keynesian macroeconomic model for the classroom. The model is built on the post-Keynesian view of a monetary production economy with creditor-debtor relationships and the endogeneity of the volume of credit and the stock of money. The model contains distribution conflict between firms and workers which will determine the wage and profit shares and may generate conflict inflation, and distribution conflict between rentiers (creditors) and firms (debtors) mainly affected by interest rate policies of the central bank and by (unexpected) inflation generated in the distribution conflict between workers and firms. The model generates a short-run `inflation barrier', which becomes endogenous to demand determined employment and macroeconomic policies in the long run. Based on the model we will provide a full post-Keynesian macroeconomic policy mix as an alternative to the New Consensus Macroeconomics. In this alternative policy package monetary policy should target low long-run real interest rates, take over responsibility for financial stability, and act as a lender of last resort and a guarantor of government debt. Nominal stabilisation should be addressed by income and wage policy, in particular through mediation of distributional conflicts via wage bargaining co-ordination. Real stabilisation and aggregate demand management, both in the short and in the long run, should be the task of fiscal policy, making use of government deficits/surpluses following a `functional finance' approach.},

Therefore, firms are supposed to adjust productive capacity to demand in the long run, and capacity utilization should be equal to firms' target rate of utilization in a `fully adjusted long-run position'.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses under which circumstances and how configurational comparative methods (i.e. QCA) and statistical methods can be combined to provide tests for the `quasi'-sufficiency of any given set of combination of causal conditions. When combined, QCA provides the ability to explore causal substitutability (i.e. multiple paths to a given outcome) and the ways in which many multiple causes interact with one another to produce effects, while the statistical elements can provide robust indications of the probable validity of postulated hypotheses. The potential utility of the mixed-method approach for analyzing political phenomena is demonstrated by applying it to cross-national data regarding party positions on European integration and party-based Euroscepticism in Western Europe. The findings show that oppositional stances to European integration are partly associated with non-governmental ideological fringe parties on both the left and right. The empirical example presented in this paper demonstrates that configurational methods can be successfully combined with statistical methods and supplement the QCA-framework by providing statistical tests of `almost sufficient' claims. However, combining QCA with statistical methods can sometimes be problematic in middle-sized data analysis, especially as the latter usually cannot handle limited diversity (i.e. insufficient information) in the data and/or overtly complex relationships (i.e. having a large number of conjunctional conditions or interacting variables).},

Here the profit rate is given by processes in the financial market and the degree of financialisation. Also the degree of monopoly influences functional income distribution. The Keynesian and Kaleckian approach allows a plausible interpretation of the changes in functional income distribution during recent decades.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed increasing interests in integrating temporality into Boolean analysis or Qualitative Comparative Analysis (hereafter QCA). Despite the rapid development of the Boolean method and the extensive application, QCA had been often criticized for its static nature and limitations in analyzing a dynamic process of temporal changes. This article joins the recent efforts in the literature and argues that temporal changes can be analyzed using the existing QCA methods. The article first reviews the existing work on temporal QCA (hereafter TQCA) in a broader context of analyzing temporality in the Boolean method. It then proposes different techniques to analyze dynamic processes of temporal changes through Boolean analysis by incorporating time-series variations into QCA (hereafter TS/QCA), which take sub-forms of Pooled QCA, Fixed Effects QCA, and Time Differencing QCA. Lastly, it maps various types of ``QCA families`` in a typological framework and discusses the challenges that TQCA and TS/QCA face and suggest future directions of methodological innovations.},

  abstract = {Workplace ethnographies suggest many hypotheses about the effects of organizational characteristics on employee attitudes and behaviors. These hypotheses, however, are difficult to evaluate by considering each ethnography individually. The current article uses qualitative comparative analysis of content-coded data from the full population of workplace ethnographies to provide a fuller evaluation of the lessons these ethnographies have to offer. The hypothesis that women are happy and quiescent workers receives only limited support. Women actually evidence less satisfaction and pride in their work than men, but they are more cooperative and less conflictual than men. Autonomy is the most consistent determinant of positive workplace attitudes, a finding that is consistent with survey-based research. These findings thus both confirm and condition prior conclusions about the workplace and suggest the importance of systematically compiling the findings of workplace ethnographies to evaluate and benchmark conclusions based on ethnographic analysis.},

However, their reactions to the crisis greatly differed. While many states passed extensive economic stimulus packages, others solely relied on a restrictive fiscal policy even in times of economic crisis. The composition of the fiscal packages also greatly varied. While some states increased public expenditure and expanded state investments, others enacted considerable tax reductions, thus focusing on an economic stimulus by forgoing public revenue.This paper aims to identify the main political determinants of the different fiscal policy reactions of the OECD member states to the economic crisis. The centerpiece of the comparative analysis consists of political economic determinants of the size and composition of the fiscal packages. A fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis serves to identify the driving forces behind the fiscal policy reactions to the crisis. The conditions are derived from partisan political theory and the ``Varieties of Capitalism'' approach while other factors are controlled for.},

Next, it examines the data of the last National Sample Survey of Households of Brazil (PNAD, 2007), to update the analysis of the distribution of per capita household income in Brazil and verify how income from work (of the military and civil servants, of other employees, of self-employed and of employers), from pensions, from rents and from other components of income influence income inequality in Brazil. Finally, it examines how each of these components contributed to reduce the Gini index of the distribution of per capita household income in Brazil in the period 2001-2007. It becomes evident that about 50\% of such reduction in the Gini index is associated with changes in the income component ``wages in the private sector''. Another conclusion is that the pensions provided by the official system are regressive, even though changes in the income from pensions in the last years have contributed to the reduction of the Gini index.},

One of the results is that for all the five measures used, the concentration ratio of pensions is higher than the overall index of inequality, indicating that this component is contributing to the increase in income inequality.},

  abstract = {In this study, we analyse the determinants of bank credit to the private non-financial sector in 16 industrialized countries based on a cointegrating VAR. Cointegration analysis suggests that property prices are an important determinant of the long-run borrowing capacity of the private sector, which needs to be taken into account to explain the long-run movements of bank lending. Impulse response analysis reveals that innovations to property prices also have a highly significant and persistent positive dynamic effect on bank lending. This result suggests that innovations to property prices may give rise to significant and persistent cycles in bank lending and are thus a potential explanation for the persistent financial cycles observed in the past.

  abstract = {In almost all European welfare states, immigrants face a higher risk of poverty than natives, but the gap between the two groups varies. In examining this variation, our article contributes to the nascent literature on the impact of welfare states on immigrants. We hypothesize that whether immigrants benefit from welfare generosity depends on three intervening factors: immigration policy, labor market regulation, and welfare eligibility rules. We use fuzzy-set analysis to examine the interplay of these determinants in 16 West-European states. The findings show that in most countries a high migrant disadvantage results from the combination of a large share of humanitarian and family immigrants and generous social policies. The underlying mechanism is that ``unwanted'' immigrants are institutionally impeded from full access to generous welfare states.},

Several hypotheses are put to the test: first, a classical partisan difference argument; second, a varieties of capitalism approach proposing a successful joint rallying of employers and employees for subsidization in coordinated market economies; and, lastly, the merged hypothesis that right?wing parties in a coordinated economic context might subsidize feeling the pressure to overcompensate an ?issue ownership? of left parties in the field of employee?friendly policies. We identify four explanatory paths: coordinated economies in the sample subsidized when they were economically closed or highly indebted. The results also support our combined hypothesis, that New Zealand ? a left?governed liberal market economy ? and right?governed coordinated market economies of the non?Scandinavian type subsidized.},

Governments have responded with a wide array of measures to protect tenants and mortgage-holders, as well as support builders and lenders. This note mobilises web-search data to shed new light on the impact of the crisis on the construction sector. It then takes stock of measures taken by governments and argues that some of the relief could, if not duly phased out as planned, create unintended inefficiencies and notably make housing supply less responsive to changes in demand and the evolving needs of society. The note concludes by building on recent empirical findings that stress the importance of gradually transitioning from immediate rescue measures to policy settings that can support the recovery and the development of efficient, inclusive and sustainable housing markets.},

  abstract = {China is an ownership society, but with a paradox \textendash{} many homeowners do not live in the apartments/houses they own, and instead live in rental housing. This is different from the pattern in Western economies where households own multiple properties but still live in an owned unit. The paper is situated within the literature on the financialization of housing and the changing meaning of homeownership. We examine the paradox by studying its patterns and dynamics using 2017 China Household Finance Survey data. We find that the owner-renting in China is a result of spatial, temporal and functional mismatches between housing needs. The intrinsic investment strategy and services linked to homeownership have made it imperative to own homes, regardless a household's housing needs. Young, single, better-off and split households, and those in large, expensive cities are more likely to be owners-renting. In addition, institutional barriers in the housing market such as migrant status, housing purchase limit policy, and subsidized housing encourage owner-renting.},

We go beyond existing scholarship by specifying which aspects of financialization can be expected to increase inequality and where in the income distribution this effect will occur. We also show that this effect is contingent on institutional context. We posit that the shareholder model of corporate governance and the growing demand for financial professionals are the two dimensions of financialization that drive up pre-tax income inequality. Nevertheless, the spread of the shareholder value model only benefits the very top income earners. We further argue that the institutional strength of labor shapes the relationship between financialization and inequality. We analyze effects of indicators of these two dimensions of financialization on the top 1\% and the next 9\% income shares and on the 90:50 earnings ratio. We test our hypotheses with data on 18 post-industrial democracies between 1960 and 2015.},

  abstract = {This study aims to develop an empirical measurement framework of the green state and compare twenty-four OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries\&rsquo; cases through the fuzzy-set multiple conjunctural analysis and the ideal type analysis. Based on the analysis model of the outcome set (Sustainable Development Goal Index) and the causal sets of seven variables on the four green state categories (\&lsquo;ecological authoritarian state\&rsquo;, \&lsquo;ecological modern state\&rsquo;, \&lsquo;ecological democracy state\&rsquo;, and \&lsquo;ecological welfare state\&rsquo;), this study reveals the following results. Among OECD member countries, if ones have high environmental tax, high environmental innovation (patent), high economic development and democracy, high levels of environmental governance and social expenditure, or have high economic development and democracy, and high levels of environmental governance and environmental health, they can be seen to have reached a high level of green state (consistency: 0.980, total coverage: 0.675). Also, the thirteen ideal types of green state of twenty-four OECD countries were derived. Norway (fuzzy-set membership score of 0.515) is a country of Type 1, with a characteristic of \&lsquo;strong green state\&rsquo; having all high features of the four green state categories. Greece (membership score, 0.692) and Ireland (0.577) belong to Type 13, characterized by \&lsquo;weak green state\&rsquo; with all four low features. As a result, the green state types of the twenty-four OECD countries can be assorted into five levels: \&lsquo;Strong Green State\&rsquo;, \&lsquo;Quasi-Strong Green State\&rsquo;, \&lsquo;Quasi-Green State\&rsquo;, \&lsquo;Quasi-Weak Green State\&rsquo;, and \&lsquo;Weak Green State\&rsquo;.},

In particular it proposes a standardized t-bar test statistic based on the (augmented) Dickey\textendash Fuller statistics averaged across the groups. Under a general setting this statistic is shown to converge in probability to a standard normal variate sequentially with T (the time series dimension) \textrightarrow{$\infty$}, followed by N (the cross sectional dimension) \textrightarrow{$\infty$}. A diagonal convergence result with T and N\textrightarrow{$\infty$} while N/T\textrightarrow k,k being a finite non-negative constant, is also conjectured. In the special case where errors in individual Dickey\textendash Fuller (DF) regressions are serially uncorrelated a modified version of the standardized t-bar statistic is shown to be distributed as standard normal as N\textrightarrow{$\infty$} for a fixed T, so long as T{$>$}5 in the case of DF regressions with intercepts and T{$>$}6 in the case of DF regressions with intercepts and linear time trends. An exact fixed N and T test is also developed using the simple average of the DF statistics. Monte Carlo results show that if a large enough lag order is selected for the underlying ADF regressions, then the small sample performances of the t-bar test is reasonably satisfactory and generally better than the test proposed by Levin and Lin (Unpublished manuscript, University of California, San Diego, 1993).},

Democratic countries have been among the earliest adopters of new legislation in transparency reforms such as access to information (ATI) laws. However, research has not yet tested the connection in the context of democratic reform where transitioning countries have the option to adopt ATI laws, and yet may, nevertheless, neglect or delay passage of such laws. To address this question, this paper uses Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) with 23 countries that are in democratic transition in the fourth wave of democratic transition in the 21st century. The results show that low political competition in conjunction with strong civil society, regional pressure and recognition of international norms is favourable to ATI adoption. In contrast, the non-ATI adopters have encountered high political competition coupled with low regional pressure, weak international norms, and weak press freedoms.},

  abstract = {A good regulatory quality reflects perceptions of the capability of the regulatory to frame and implement sound policies and regulations that permit and help all sector development. Following the spread of COVID-19 and increased financial volatility, the growth of FDI and trade outlook for the region in 2020 has been sharply downgraded. This study aims to observe empirically the effect of government spending in heath sectors on economic growth during in the early stage Covid 19 outbreak in Malaysia. As the world has awakened to the potential risks of Covid 19, there has been a massive effort to add capacity to the healthcare system rapidly. In Malaysia, apart from stressing the need for the public to strictly adhere to the Movement Control Order (MCO), the government an immediate boost in funding for healthcare services through initial stage fiscal policy response to Covid 19 outbreak. This research used Dynamic Panel Data also known as longitudinal study, observed data over the four month from December, 2019 to March, 2020 in 5 selected Asia Country that involving with Covid 19. In term of limitation, this study just focusses on four month of data from selected Asia country involved with Covid-19. Panel causality results suggest bidirectional linkages between healthcare sector growth and government spending. Empirical findings suggest that fiscal policy reforms are required to channelize healthcare sector growth to a more government spending resulting from fiscal policy designed by the government of Malaysia. In addition, Panel causality results suggest bidirectional linkages between inward FDI and regulatory quality. Empirical findings suggest that economic policy reforms are required to channelize regulatory quality of COVID-19 to a more foreign capital inflows. The governments of Asian countries should pull out policies on FDI inflows and the environment in order to achieve sustainable economic growth and development. The regulators of other countries should pull out fiscal policies on government policy to achieve sustainable economic growth and health sector growth development.},

  abstract = {Purpose This study is a practice undertaking examining three main concerns that currently dominate Dutch housing market debate: how long is the cycle, will the current house price inflation continue and is housing market in a bubble. With national house prices reaching record highs across all major cities, future market prospects became a topic of significant debate among policymakers, investors and the populace. Design/methodology/approach A triangulation of well-established academic methods is used to perform investigation. The models include Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter, volatility autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH approximation) and right tail augmented Dickey\textendash Fuller (Rtadf) test (bubble screening technique). Findings Interestingly, over the years from 1985 to 2019 research period, filtering extracts only one Dutch national housing cycle. This is a somewhat distinct characteristic compared to other advanced Western economies (inter alia the UK and the USA) where markets tend to experience 8- to 10-year gyrations. Volatility and Rtadf test suggest that current house prices in most Dutch cities are in excess of historical averages and statistical thresholds. House price levels in Almere, Amsterdam, The Hague, Groningen, Rotterdam and Utrecht are of particular concern. Originality/value Retail investors should therefore be cautious as they are entering the market at the time of elevated housing values. For institutional investors, those investing in long-term, housing in key Dutch metropolitan areas, even if values decline, is still an attractive investment conduit.},

  abstract = {After the 2007 credit crisis, financial bubbles have once again emerged as a topic of current concern. An open problem is to determine in real time whether or not a given asset's price process exhibits a bubble. Due to recent progress in the characterization of asset price bubbles using the arbitrage-free martingale pricing technology, we are able to propose a new methodology for answering this question based on the asset's price volatility. We limit ourselves to the special case of a risky asset's price being modeled by a Brownian driven stochastic differential equation. Such models are ubiquitous both in theory and in practice. Our methods use sophisticated volatility estimation techniques combined with the method of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We illustrate these techniques using several stocks from the alleged Internet dot-com episode of 1998\textendash 2001, where price bubbles were widely thought to have existed. Our results confirm the suspicions of the presence of bubbles in many of the dot-com stocks of 1998\textendash 2001.},

These studies typically identify multiple factors that are behind the emergence of large and successful firms in particular national clusters. However, there has been relatively little research identifying whether such factors are all collectively necessary to produce the outcome, or whether only a few of the factors in different combinations might be sufficient to generate the shift in competitive advantage manifested in the market power of large ``flagship'' firms. In this paper, we study the evolution of one industry across six countries in which the competitive position of national firms changed considerably during our 100-year analysis period. The results of our combined historical and fuzzy-set analyses show that an unequal distribution of resources may lead to alternative causal pathways to competitive advantage of the largest firms.},

We show that the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator is mixed Gaussian. Once a certain eigenvalue problem is solved and the eigenvectors and eigenvalues calculated, one can conduct inference on the cointegrating rank using some nonstandard distributions, and test hypotheses about cointegrating relations using the {$\chi$} \textsuperscript{2} distribution.},

  abstract = {International political economy identifies declining nominal interest rates, securitization, and financial liberalization as drivers of rising housing prices. Despite witnessing these common credit shocks, however, developed economies experienced divergent trends in housing inflation since the 1980s. We offer a comparative political economy explanation of variation in house prices, arguing that by restraining household incomes, wage-setting institutions can blunt financial liberalization's inflationary impact on housing markets. Employing quantitative analysis and a comparative study of Ireland and the Netherlands, we uncover two findings. First, countries where political coalitions in the export sector held veto powers over those in the nontraded sector in national wage setting realized lower housing inflation. Second, the impact of sectoral coalitions on housing prices in OECD countries is similar to that of financial variables. Our results suggest that the organization of labor politics continues to play an important role in mitigating the destabilizing effects of global finance on developed economies.},

(3) The long-term accessibility of homeownership and its affordability for young adults. (4) The price adjustment in housing markets following the financial crisis has been relatively weak when contrasted with housing construction activity that has collapsed. (5) The post-credit-crunch world with tight public sector finances means that new models of funding are required for social housing blurring the differences with private rented accommodation.

In contrast to Kaldor's facts, which revolved around a single state variable, physical capital, our six updated facts force consideration of four far more interesting variables: ideas, institutions, population, and human capital. Dynamic models have uncovered subtle interactions between these variables and generated important insights about such big questions as: Why has growth accelerated? Why are there gains from trade?},

This ``financial hockey stick'' coincides with shifts in foundational macroeconomic relationships beyond the widely-noted return of macroeconomic fragility and crisis risk. Leverage is correlated with central business cycle moments, which we can document thanks to a decade-long international and historical data collection effort. More financialized economies exhibit somewhat less real volatility, but also lower growth, more tail risk, as well as tighter real-real and real-financial correlations. International real and financial cycles also cohere more strongly. The new stylized facts that we discover should prove fertile ground for the development of a new generation of macroeconomic models with a prominent role for financial factors.},

We use novel instrumental variable local projection methods to demonstrate that loose monetary conditions lead to booms in real estate lending and house prices' bubbles; these, in turn, materially heighten the risk of financial crises.

Using a new database for the U.S. and 15 other advanced economies from 1870 to the present that includes housing as well as equity returns (to capture the full risky capital portfolio of the representative agent), standard calculations using returns to total wealth and consumption show that: housing returns in the long run are comparable to those of equities, and yet housing returns have lower volatility and lower covariance with consumption growth than equities. The same applies to a weighted total-wealth portfolio, and over a range of horizons. As a result, the implied risk aversion parameters for housing wealth and total wealth are even larger than those for equities, often by a factor of 2 or more. We find that more exotic models cannot resolve these even bigger puzzles, and we see little role for limited participation, idiosyncratic housing risk, transaction costs, or liquidity premiums.},

  abstract = {Capitalism is the dominant economic system adopted throughout the global economy, but there are many different models of capitalism practiced depending on what the society decides ``economic effectiveness'' is. In this study, we assert that an effective economy simultaneously achieves two seemingly divergent outcomes: it (1) creates economic wealth efficiently, and (2) shares that wealth equitably. Employing insights from Whitley's national business systems framework and fuzzy set analysis, we examine how national institutions collectively configure with respect to the overall level of equitable wealth creation within 48 developed and developing economies. We find that three configurations are associated with relatively high levels of equitable wealth creation, and another three are associated with relatively low levels. As such, our analysis supports the notion of equifinality \textendash{} that there is no one optimal model of capitalism. Furthermore, we begin to demonstrate that these models of capitalism are constantly evolving, but their evolution is generally slow even when considering the practice of capitalism before and after the 2008 global economic crisis. We discuss the implications of these findings for the study of international business, with a special emphasis on considering a more holistic context for exploring how multinational enterprises interact with their institutional environment(s).},

The authors analyse the ecosystems of 43 countries using fsQCA in order to establish the configurations of ecosystem components that enable financial inclusion and those that lead to financial exclusion. Results show that there are three configurations of factors affecting financial inclusion: high socio-demographic and political factors in the absence of economical development; high social, technological and economical factors in the absence of political development; and political and economical factors in the absence of social and technological development. Two combinations of factors affecting financial exclusion are the absence of social and economical factors in the presence of political and technological development; finally, the configuration with absent socio-demographic, technological and political factors of development. The results obtained have policy implications for countries seeking to develop financial inclusion, outlining the most important spheres of the ecosystem to promote and support.},

The results from various studies are used to develop an axiomatic knowledge database, and then the fuzzy programming logic engine processes it to present logical answers to decision maker's queries to the system. We present a sample application to show the methodology being applied to an example problem.},

A novel price index for residential property prices covering the whole country going back to 1993 is used in a macroeconomic model to estimate key housing market elasticities for Germany. A decomposition suggests that the land price component of house prices is relatively elastic with respect to income and interest rates, while the construction price component responds to income and the level of construction activity. The decomposition also highlights countervailing house price effects of a supply increase: A dampening effect via land prices and a stimulating effect via construction prices.},

  abstract = {This article argues, using the example of Brazil, that the changing nature of developing and emerging countries' (DECs) financial integration has created new forms of external vulnerability, causing large and volatile capital and exchange rate movements. Despite sound fundamentals and a substantial reduction in its traditional external vulnerabilities, the Brazilian real has been one of the most volatile currencies over recent years. The article argues that this has been the result of the surging exposure of foreign investors in an increasingly complex set of very short-term domestic currency assets. Following a Minskyan analysis, we demonstrate that the changing nature of Brazil's external vulnerability confirms both the inherent and endogenous instability of international capital flows and DECs' subordinate role in the international financial system. We conclude with policy recommendations to reduce DECs' external vulnerability sustainably.},

We show that the OLS, FMOLS, and DOLS estimators are all asymptotically normally distributed. However, the asymptotic distribution of the OLS estimator is shown to have a non-zero mean. Monte Carlo results illustrate the sampling behavior of the proposed estimators and show that (1) the OLS estimator has a non-negligible bias in finite samples, (2) the FMOLS estimator does not improve over the OLS estimator in general, and (3) the DOLS outperforms both the OLS and FMOLS estimators.},

Specifically, it integrates the Veblenian concept of conspicuous consumption into a typical Bhaduri-Marglin model by assuming that relative consumption concerns matter primarily within the working class. If in such a framework the profit share increases and the corresponding decrease in workers' income is distributed unevenly, efforts to ''keep up with the Joneses'' may increase consumption and, hence, lead to a consumption-driven profit-led regime. The model's empirical relevance is illustrated with respect to the pre-crisis developments as observed in the U.S.},

Through a series of counterfactual experiments, we study the housing boom and bust around the Great Recession and obtain three main results. First, we find that the main driver of movements in house prices and rents was a shift in beliefs. Shifts in credit conditions do not move house prices but are important for the dynamics of home ownership, leverage, and foreclosures. The role of housing rental markets and long-term mortgages in alleviating credit constraints is central to these findings. Second, our model suggests that the boom-bust in house prices explains half of the corresponding swings in non-durable expenditures and that the transmission mechanism is a wealth effect through household balance sheets. Third, we find that a large-scale debt forgiveness program would have done little to temper the collapse of house prices and expenditures, but would have dramatically reduced foreclosures and induced a small, but persistent, increase in consumption during the recovery.},

The rules are: (i) government expenditures as a fixed proportion of GDP; (ii) government deficit as a fixed proportion of GDP; (iii) government debt as a fixed proportion of GDP; and (iv) a balanced budget. Next, the economic trends implied by each rule are analyzed, and they are all compared. Some of the main findings of the exercise can be summarized as follows: the a priori more expansionist (or less contractionist) rules present higher growth rates, ex post; there is an inverse relationship between government debt and firms' debt, with the former being higher under the first rule, and lower in the balanced budget rule, the opposite happening in the case of firms' debt. Finally, considering enterprises' profitability, we conclude that the best fiscal rule for firms is the first one, and, for the banking sector, not surprisingly, it is the balanced budget rule.},

  abstract = {The financialisation literature has grown over the past decades. Despite a generally accepted definition, financialisation has been used to describe different phenomena. We distinguish between financialisation of non-financial companies, households and the financial sector and use activity and vulnerability measures. We identify seven financialisation hypotheses in the literature and empirically investigate them in a cross-country analysis for 17 OECD countries for 1997-2007. We find different financialisation measures are only weakly correlated, suggesting the existence of distinct financialisation processes. There is strong evidence that financialisation is linked to asset price inflation and correlated with a debt-driven demand regime. Financial deregulation encourages financialisation. There is limited evidence that market-based financial systems are more financialised. Foreign financial inflows do not seem a main driver. We do not find indication that an investment slowdown precedes financialisation. Our findings suggest financialisation should be understood as variegated process, playing out differently across economic sectors and countries.},

  abstract = {Both, the housing bubble and financial crisis, are prime examples of complex events. Complex in the sense that there were several interconnected and interdependent root causes. This paper presents an agent-based model (ABM) to model the housing market from 1986 to 2017. We provide a unique approach to simulating the financial market along with analyzing the phenomenon of emergence resulting from the interactions among consumers, banks and the Federal Reserve. This paper specifically focuses on the emergence of ``underwater mortgages'' and the macroeconomics of the housing market. The market value of a property is heavily influence by the value of a neighboring property; therefore, individuals are able to gauge the probable value of a property that has not been developed yet. The blend of available financial products to consumers (i.e., ARM versus Fixed-Rate) certainly influences demand within the housing market given that ARM products are more affordable than fixed-rate products. Policymakers and financial institutions should work together to develop programs, which monitor the supply of these historically easy to access financial products and prevent the risk of underwater mortgages and crashes.},

These events call into question the canonical life-cycle theory of consumption, with its benign view of debt as a neutral instrument of optimal intertemporal expenditure smoothing. This paper draws attention to an alternative, post-Keynesian account of consumption spending in which current income, household borrowing and household indebtedness all affect current consumption. Central to the analysis is an empirical investigation of US consumption spending since the 1950s. The results of this inquiry cast doubt on the life-cycle hypothesis, but are congruent with the alternative, post-Keynesian account of consumption.},

Particular attention is paid to the debate over house price bubbles, housing wealth effects on consumption, and the causality between house price and inflation.

The objective of stock flow modeling should be the ability to practically model unstable macro-economies, and in particular their interactions with the financial sector. These models should provide `Words to the Wise', and until they do, they are just thought experiments.},

The peer effect from corporate real estate is stronger when firms or their peers have more investment opportunities; financially constrained firms invest more out of their own price shocks, while the peer effect is stronger for unconstrained firms; and we find significant peer effects within but not between - groups of small and large firms, respectively.

Works in the financialisation literature have tried to explain this phenomenon by arguing that rising financial payments and purchases have come at the expense of productive investment.This article shows that such arguments are not supported by the data. It also explains theoretically why rising dividend payments and the growth of corporations' portfolio investment are compatible with the fact that corporations' productive investment did not decline during the first two decades of `neoliberalism' in the USA.There would necessarily be a trade-off between these uses of funds if they were all funded out of current profits, but there is no necessary trade-off because borrowed funds are an additional source. Finally, the article shows that the fall in US corporations' rate of profit (rate of return on investment in fixed assets) fully accounts for the fall in their rate of capital accumulation.},

Third, the chapter examines the degree to which increasing housing wealth and HEW have been responsible for the decline in US saving. It addresses these questions, comparing the US experience with that of Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom (UK) to see if other countries with competitive mortgage markets and similar home ownership rates provide additional insight into the interaction of housing wealth and savings. The chapter uses an econometric model to explore the reasons for the decline in the household saving rate and the role HEW might play, focusing on four explanatory variables.

  abstract = {Real residential investment in Germany is found to be cointegrated with population, real national income per capita and real house prices. This evidence is consistent with a model where the trend in housing demand is determined by demographic factors and economic well-being to which supply adjusts so slowly that real house prices are affected persistently. Reunification seems to have induced two structural changes in the empirical housingmarketmodel. First, the speed of equilibriumadjustment via residential investment slowed down substantially and real house prices lost the capacity to contribute to the adjustment process. Second, the degree of persistence in the error correction term increased a lot. The changing features are key to explain significant differences in alternative trend-cycle decompositions of residential investment.},

We show that real house prices stayed constant from the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, but rose strongly and with substantial cross-country variation in the second half of the twentieth century. Land prices, not replacement costs, are the key to understanding the trajectory of house prices. Rising land prices explain about 80 percent of the global house price boom that has taken place since World War II. Our findings have implications for the evolution of wealth-to-income ratios, the growth effects of agglomeration, and the price elasticity of housing supply.},

Higher prices increase the value of collateral and net wealth of borrowers and thus reduce the likelihood of credit defaults. In contrast, persistent deviations from fundamentals may foster the adverse selection of increasingly risky creditors by banks seeking to expand their loan portfolios, which increases bank distress probabilities. We test these hypotheses using unique data on real estate markets and banks in Germany. House price deviations contribute to bank instability, but nominal house price developments do not. This finding corroborates the importance of deviations from the fundamental value of real estate, rather than just price levels or changes alone, when assessing bank stability.},

As one of the main drivers of financial sector growth, mortgages have traditionally been hailed as increasing the number of homeowners in a country. This article uses long-run panel data for seventeen countries between 1920 (1950) and 2013 to show that the effect of the ``great mortgaging'' on homeownership rates is not universally positive. Increasing mortgage debt appears to be neither necessary nor sufficient for higher homeownership levels. There were periods of rising homeownership levels without much increase in mortgages before 1980, thanks to government programs, purchasing power increases, and less inflated house prices. There have also been mortgage increases without homeownership growth, but with house price bubbles thereafter. The liberalization of financial markets might after all be a poor substitute for more traditional housing policies.},

So, each rule is a possible path from the causal conditions to the outcome. The rules are connected by the word OR to the output. To actually apply fsQCA to some engineering data problems, there are some challenges that had to be overcome. We explain the challenges and how they have been overcome.

The previous two expansions, of the 1990s and 2000s, were prolonged by big asset bubbles, which have played a key role in the neoliberal era in promoting long economic expansions. However, the current expansion has not seen an asset bubble large enough to significantly affect the macroeconomy. This paper examines the expansion since 2009 by analyzing the movements of the rate of profit, and its determinants, and the role of aggregate demand, with the aim of determining the factors that have kept crisis tendencies at bay so far., JEL Classification: E32, E30, E11, E02},

  abstract = {Wage growth and consumer price inflation in the United States remain weak, despite robust labor market and a healthy economy. This has been a conundrum for policymakers and economists alike, albeit it is not without parallels. In this paper, we analyze recent trends in the labor market. We point out that a number of indicators are providing mixed signals about the tight labor market, including wage growth that has remained muted, vacancy duration rates that have stayed remarkable stable in certain sectors, and the rate of capacity utilization, which is cyclically low and out of sync with other measures of resource utilization (e.g., output gap and unemployment rate). This leads us to conclude that there could be other forces that explain these phenomena. In this paper, we focus on capacity utilization and contend that low capacity utilization rates are the outcome of strategic decision-making by corporations, rather than inefficient demand, which permits firms to manage their resources more effectively. It seems to be particularly important when economic and policy uncertainties are elevated, such as in the post-financial crisis environment. More flexible use of capacity has implications not only for the labor market, but also for investments. Understanding capacity utilization would contribute to monetary policy formulation when the signal coming from the rate of capacity utilization is not consistent with those coming from the labor market and the output gap. This points to the need to continue monitor a broad range of indicators to avoid potential policy errors.},

This article demonstrates, however, that fsQCA is an extraordinarily sensitive method whose results are worryingly susceptible to minor parametric and model specification changes. We make two specific claims. First, the causal conditions identified by fsQCA as being sufficient for an outcome to occur are highly contingent upon the values of several key parameters selected by the user. Second, fsQCA results are subject to marked confirmation bias. Given its tendency toward finding complex connections between variables, the method is highly likely to identify as sufficient for an outcome causal combinations containing even randomly generated variables. To support these arguments, we replicate three articles utilizing fsQCA and conduct sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations to assess the impact of small changes in parameter values and the method's built-in confirmation bias on the overall conclusions about sufficient conditions.},

  abstract = {Studies employing Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) often analyze a relatively small number of cases (n) to assess the impact of a substantial number of variables (k) on a given outcome. In the tradition of writing on the comparative method and multi-method research, however, this ratio of cases-to-variables is viewed as an analytic problem.

This article shows how, using a sequential design, the integration of a large-N survival analysis with a smaller-N QCA yielded new insights about the reasons for project delay in a multiproject organization. While the regression served to trace significant explanatory variables and their net effects, the QCA nuanced these findings by demonstrating how variables combine across distinct categories of cases. As a result, the differing logics underlying externally and internally generated delays were elucidated. Implications for our understanding of multiproject organizing and for mixed methods research are discussed.},

Some support is provided for the view that the short run is sometimes a "cooperative game" in which both labor and capital gain. Copyright 1990 by Oxford University Press.},

Measured as residential investment, the lead is observed only in the United States and Canada; elsewhere, residential investment is coincident. Variants of existing theory, however, predict housing construction lagging GDP. In all countries in the sample, nominal interest rates are low ahead of GDP peaks. Introducing long-term nominal mortgages, and an estimated process for nominal interest rates, into a standard model aligns the theory with observations on starts, as mortgages transmit nominal rates into real housing costs. Longer time to build makes residential investment cyclically coincident.},

This technique allows simultaneously addressing individual e ects, numerous periods, and in turn, the endogeneity of the model or independent regressors. Despite these advantages, there are several methodological and practical limitations to perform estimations using this tool. There are two types of models that can be estimated with Panel data: Static and Dynamic, the former is the most developed while dynamic models still have some theoretical and practical constraints. This paper focuses precisely on the latter, Dynamic panel data, using an approach that combines theory and praxis, and paying special attention on its applicability on macroeonomic data, specially datasets with a long period of time and a small number of individuals, also called long panels.},

  abstract = {Introdu\c{c}\~ao retomada do crescimento se apresenta como um dos grandes desafios para a sociedade brasileira ap\'os dois anos de profunda crise, em 2015 e 2016. Depois de um per\'iodo de expans\~ao da renda e diminui\c{c}\~ao da desi-gualdade na primeira d\'ecada deste s\'eculo, fortemente influenciada pelo desem-penho da economia mundial e da eleva\c{c}\~ao dos pre\c{c}os das commodities, vemo--nos novamente diante da recess\~ao e seus reflexos. Recuperar os investimentos \'e algo que se mostra imprescind\'ivel para a sa\'ida da crise. Foram v\'arios os fatores que fizeram que houvesse essa retra\c{c}\~ao. O almejado ajuste fiscal implicou cortes de gastos, incluindo os investi-mentos, n\~ao apenas por parte da Uni\~ao, mas tamb\'em dos estados e munic\'ipios. Ressalte-se ainda que o aumento da taxa b\'asica de juros (Selic) e a sua manuten-\c{c}\~ao em n\'ivel elevado, al\'em de estimular as aplica\c{c}\~oes financeiras em detrimento dos investimentos na produ\c{c}\~ao e infraestrutura, tamb\'em encareceu o custo do cr\'edito e do financiamento, outro fator desestimulador das novas invers\~oes. Um terceiro fator foi o impacto da retra\c{c}\~ao chinesa e a queda nos pre\c{c}os das commodities. Ao contr\'ario do se poderia pensar, a diminui\c{c}\~ao dos pre\c{c}os do petr\'oleo bruto, dos min\'erios e da soja, para citar os principais, n\~ao afetou so-mente o resultado das exporta\c{c}\~oes, mas tamb\'em inibiu novos projetos por parte de grandes empresas, devido \`a queda da sua receita e rentabilidade. O quarto fator, a Opera\c{c}\~ao Lava Jato, sem entrar no m\'erito da sua utilida-de para coibir a corrup\c{c}\~ao, tem significado na pr\'atica a paralisia de setores-chave para o pa\'is, como os complexos de petr\'oleo e g\'as, constru\c{c}\~ao pesada e toda a sua cadeia de fornecedores e prestadores de servi\c{c}os. Por \'ultimo, mas n\~ao menos importante, a crise pol\'itica gera incerteza quanto ao futuro, tamb\'em impactando negativamente as decis\~oes, levando ao adiamento, ou mesmo cancelamento de investimentos. Como todos esses fatores continuam presentes no cen\'ario pol\'itico-eco-n\^omico, nada nos faz crer que o quadro possa se alterar e teremos uma nova retra\c{c}\~ao expressiva nos investimentos este ano. Mas, por outro lado, nada indica que estejamos fadados a uma crise intermi-n\'avel. H\'a aspectos relevantes a serem considerados. O Brasil \'e o \'unico pa\'is do G-20 que tem, por exemplo, uma expressiva demanda ainda reprimida na infraestrutura. H\'a muitas outras oportunidades no agroneg\'ocio, na ind\'ustria e nos servi\c{c}os. Din\^amica e evolu\c{c}\~ao da crise: discutindo alternativas ANTONIO CORR\^EA DE LACERDA I A 10.1590/s0103-40142017.31890005 ESTUDOS AVAN\c{C}ADOS 31 (89), 2017 38 Isso talvez explique a atratividade da economia brasileira para investimen-tos do exterior que tem coberto com sobra os d\'eficits no balan\c{c}o de transa\c{c}\~oes correntes. S\'o de investimentos diretos estrangeiros houve ingressos de US\$ 79 bilh\~oes no acumulado de 2016, colocando-nos dentre os sete pa\'ises que mais receberam essa modalidade de capitais, que incluem as fus\~oes e aquisi\c{c}\~oes e ainda os empr\'estimos intercompanhia. Ou seja, apesar da crise, muitas empresas estrangeiras se interessaram em investir no Brasil, certamente considerando o potencial de mercado e de crescimento futuro. Internamente, as elevadas taxas de juros oferecidas para os credores da d\'ivida p\'ublica continuam sendo um fator de desest\'imulo aos investimentos em novos projetos de infraestrutura. No \^ambito federal h\'a um montante mapeado de projetos da ordem de R\$ 200 bilh\~oes em infraestrutura, envolvendo estradas, ferrovias, portos, aero-portos. S\~ao oportunidades que, no entanto, n\~ao devem se desenvolver no curto prazo. Al\'em do aspecto j\'a apontado da elevada taxa de juros, prevalecem outros de incerteza, como a quest\~ao do licenciamento ambiental, que \'e bastante demo-rada, al\'em de entraves burocr\'aticos e administrativos. Portanto, a cria\c{c}\~ao de um ambiente favor\'avel aos investimentos passa pela resolu\c{c}\~ao ou minimiza\c{c}\~ao de todos os aspectos pol\'itico-econ\^omicos apontados, cuja supera\c{c}\~ao poder\'a transformar em oportunidade o que muitas vezes \'e visto apenas como problema, especialmente no que se refere aos gargalos de infraes-trutura e log\'istica.},

Sellers, buyers and banks interact within a computational framework that enables the application of LTV caps to a one-step housing market. We first conduct a simulation exercise; later, we calibrate the probability distributions based on actual European data from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey. In both cases, the application of an LTV cap results in a modified distribution of buyers in terms of property values, bidding prices and properties sold, depending on the probability distributions of the LTV ratio, wealth and debt-to-income ratios considered. The results are of similar magnitude to other studies in the literature embodying other analytical approaches, and they suggest that our methodology can potentially be used to gauge the impact of common macroprudential measures.},

  abstract = {Demand and income distribution: an analysis of the Brazilian economic growth between 1993-2013 This work aims to empirically investigate Brazilian economic growth from 1993 through 2013. It is based on Naastepad's model, which determines whether the demand-led growth is wage-led or profit-led. Thus, in order to determine the demand regime of the period, we estimated the equations for investment, exports and aggregate propensity to save. Estimating the equations allowed us to calculate the multiplier effect and investment and export elasticity effect. The demand regime in the period was wage-led, mostly due to low participation of investments and exportations in the national income. All equations were estimated by Ordinary Least Squares and showed robust standard deviation of parameters. The statistical tests, carried out after the estimation, suggest an unbiased and consistent model.},

  abstract = {In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2007\textendash 09, political economists have typically identified and interrogated speculative logics and credit-debt relations as the markers of financialized capitalism. This paper argues that assets, and the contingent processes which turn all manner of things into assets (i.e. `assetization'), can also be usefully foregrounded to understand the character and movement of financialized capitalism in the contemporary conjuncture, particularly in its Anglo-American heartlands. Centred on assets and assetization, research is refocused on the constitution of political economies of rent and investment, especially as the frontiers of financialized capitalism are extended to further incorporate nature and society. Research into financialized capitalism is also connected more explicitly to wider political debates over intensified inequalities, as the production and distribution of assets is key to wealth disparities and shapes fundamental stratifications across society.},

The essays are united not by a single topic but by a coherent set of themes - themes best described under the heading of the New Institutional Economics. These include an interest in economic processes as well as in states of equilibrium: a sensitivity to the limits and contours of human rationality: and an emphasis on the various sorts of social institutions that aid and inform economic action. But the essays are not solely methodological or critical. They also include substantive essays that illustrate the New Institutional Economics in practice.},

We deploy a Marxist framework to establish that financialisation represents a structural transformation of advanced capitalist economies with three characteristic tendencies: non-financial enterprises have acquired capacity to engage in financial activities independently; banks have turned to mediating transactions in open markets as well as lending to households; and households have been drawn into the formal financial system. Nonetheless, despite common underlying tendencies, both the form and the content taken by financialisation vary according to institutional, historical and political conditions in each country. We use data from the USA, the UK, Japan, Germany and France to establish both the underlying tendencies and the specific forms of financialisation.},

Money supply shocks are identified empirically from a vector autoregression (VAR) using restrictions that are consistent with a wide class of theoretical models. Using monthly data, I find that money shocks have real effects on the housing market: both real housing prices and housing sales (new starts and existing homes) rise in the short-run in response to positive shocks to the money supply. Simulations of the theoretical model suggest that, for reasonable parameter values, the estimated price responses are generally consistent with the theory.},

  abstract = {The 1990s, especially in the United States, witnessed an unprecedented change in income distribution, with a large redistribution towards rentiers on the one hand, and towards the upper ranks of the managerial bureaucracy on the other hand, as became ever more obvious after the financial scandals affecting large corporations such as Enron and Worldcom. This has also been accompanied by large capital gains that benefited top-file managers as well as shareholders. Ordinary employees and workers, as a counterpart, have seen their real purchasing power stagnate. Despite all this, and in contrast to the predictions of the canonical Kaleckian growth model, many countries achieved respectable growth rates of capital and output. The purpose of the present paper is to explain this paradox and to provide a consistent post-Keynesian model of growth that would model the main features identified above, making a distinction between managerial labour, basically overhead labour, and workers, essentially direct labour - a distinction that was recommended, but never implemented by Kaldor. The model is based on target-return pricing procedures. We then study the implications of cadrisme, a managerial-friendly regime based on large pay packages for the managerial class.},

  abstract = {Geoffrey Hodgson has recently published a book where he wonders why heterodox economics seems to thrive while at the same time losing ground within the most prestigious universities. Although Hodgson considers himself to be a heterodox economist, he complains about the way heterodoxy has been defined by some of its most active thinkers, in particular Frederic Lee and Tony Lawson. Hodgson believes that heterodox economics should be defined neither by a left-leaning ideology nor by critical realism. He argues that too much energy has been devoted to the study of macroeconomics by the Marxist and post-Keynesian brands of heterodox economics, as they left aside what he believes to be the crucial issue of microeconomic behaviour which can be found in behavioural and evolutionary economics. Hodgson further argues that what he considers to be the decline in the impact of heterodox economics is partly due to a lack of quality control. The paper outlines and comments on these various assertions.},

  abstract = {Sraffians and Kaleckians alike reject the belief that higher rates of accumulation need be associated with lower real wage rates or higher propensities to save. The rejection of this proposition is mainly based on the endogeneity of the rate of capacity utilization, both in the short and the long run. This endogeneity often relies on a discrepancy between the realized and the normal rates of profit, or between the realized and the target rate of capacity utilization, a discrepancy which some authors believe is unwarranted in long run analysis. Various models that eliminate this divergence are outlined. In all these models, the normal rate of profit itself is taken as an endogenous variable. In the first two models, the normal rate of profit depends either on the realized profit rate or the rate of interest. Supply-led results may then reappear in long run analysis. In the last model, one introduces the possibility of a divergence between the rate of return as assessed and targeted by firms, and the rate of return that is actually incorporated into prices. This divergence arises because of the bargaining power of workers and their real wage resistance. Under these conditions, the demand-led results of the Kaleckian tradition are recovered in a model with definite solutions.},

In the second part of the paper, the author mentions what can be considered as weaknesses of Minsky's theoretical framework, which should be avoided in future work. The third part deals with the controversial issue of whether or not Minsky was a post-Keynesian, or considered himself to be part of the post-Keynesian school of thought. The author concludes that indeed Minsky clearly stood in the post-Keynesian camp.},

  abstract = {The U.K. and U.S. housing finance systems are two of the world's most efficient. Yet both systems exhibited instability during the past decade, as reflected in high rates of individual borrower and lending institution default. The difficulties stemmed primarily from the combination of macroeconomic policy instability and preexisting housing or financial market constraints. In the United Kingdom, volatility in monetary and fiscal policy interacted with constraints on housing supply and tenure choice to produce a speculative boom and bust in house prices. In the United States, constraints on mortgage contracts led to the insolvency of specialized housing lenders when there was an abrupt change in monetary policy. Three important lessons can be learned from these events. First, important linkages exist among housing markets, the housing finance system, and the broader economy. Second, although liberalization benefits the financial system, it can exacerbate preexisting market distortions. Finally, the benefits of geographic diversification for housing lenders and insurers are significant.},

  abstract = {Of the components of GDP, residential investment offers by far the best early warning sign of an oncoming recession. Since World War II we have had eight recessions preceded by substantial problems in housing and consumer durables. Housing did not give an early warning of the Department of Defense Downturn after the Korean Armistice in 1953 or the Internet Comeuppance in 2001, nor should it have. By virtue of its prominence in our recessions, it makes sense for housing to play a prominent role in the conduct of monetary policy. A modified Taylor Rule would depend on a long-term measure of inflation having little to do with the phase in the cycle, and, in place of Taylor's output gap, housing starts and the change in housing starts, which together form the best forward-looking indicator of the cycle of which I am aware. This would create pre-emptive anti-inflation policy in the middle of the expansions when housing is not so sensitive to interest rates, making it less likely that anti-inflation policies would be needed near the ends of expansions when housing is very interest rate sensitive, thus making our recessions less frequent and/or less severe.},

They make predictions about the future, and buy and sell stock as indicated by their expectations of future risk and return. Prices are set endogenously to clear the market. Time series from this market are analyzed from the standpoint of well-known empirical features in real markets. The simulated market is able to replicate several of these phenomenon, including fundamental and technical predictability, volatility persistence, and leptokurtosis. Moreover, agent behavior is shown to be consistent with these features, in that they condition on the variables that are found to be signi"cant in the time series tests. Agents are also able to collectively learn a homogeneous rational expectations equilibrium for certain parameters giving both time series and individual forecast values consistent with the equilibrium parameter values. 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The principal criticism of the theory rests on the determination of the money supply. The supply of money is a dependent variable, not an independent one. The demand for credit determines the quantity of money, or at the very least bankers and borrowers share the responsibility. Causality is thus reversed. It is necessary to abandon the concept of money multipliers, which are relics of the quantity theory of money. Bankers can, if they so desirerespond without limitto demands for credit. They are not tied by a fixed amount of pre-existing assets. The goal of the article is to outline an explanation of these statements and provide a vision of monetary theory that is different from that usually taught.},

How can QCA be used to produce comprehensive, ingenious explanations of social phenomena?In this article, I provide such a hands-on introduction to QCA. In the first two parts, I offer a concise overview of 1. the method's main principles and advantages as well as 2. its vital concepts. In the subsequent part, I offer suggestions for 3. how to employ QCA's analytic tools in the research process and how to interpret their output. Lastly, I show 4. how QCA results can inform the data analysis. As the main contribution, I provide a template for how to reassess cases, causal recipes, and single conditions based on QCA results in order to produce better explanations of what is happening in the data. With these contributions, the article helps prospective QCA users to utilize the full potential the method offers for social science research.URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs1303154},

As both the cross-section and time series dimensions of the panel grow large, the pooled t-statistic has a limiting normal distribution that depends on the regression specification but is free from nuisance parameters. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the asymptotic results provide a good approximation to the test statistics in panels of moderate size, and that the power of the panel-based unit root test is dramatically higher, compared to performing a separate unit root test for each individual time series.},

Based on the theoretical framework of TOE (technology - organization - environment), the paper explores the dynamic mechanism of 81 listed Individual Champions' business model innovation by using the fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) method. The result shows that: Individual Champion' s business model innovation can be attributed to technology-oriented, market-oriented and technology-market-oriented, and Marketoriented business model innovation covers the most enterprises. R\&D investment at the technical level and social networks at the organizational level play an important role in business model innovation. In technology-oriented business model innovation, there is a substitution relationship between technology introduction and R\&D investment. The conclusion of this paper can provide theoretical reference and practical enlightenment for manufacturing enterprises to select and cultivate the driving force of business model innovation.},

Human capital accumulation positively impacts on workers\^a\texteuro\texttrademark{} productivity in output production and their bargaining power in wage negotiations. Differences in tax rates on wage and profit income have distributive implications for consumption and investment and so shape how effective demand varies with income distribution. In the long-run equilibrium, a rise in workers\^a\texteuro\texttrademark{} (capitalists\^a\texteuro\texttrademark ) bargaining power raises (lowers) the pre- and after-tax wage share, which raises (reduces) the rates of physical capital utilization, employment (which also measures the rate of human capital utilization) and output growth. Meanwhile, a rise in a uniform tax rate (which also denotes the share of tax spending in public education in output) lowers the long-run equilibrium values of the pre- and after-tax wage share and the rates of physical capital utilization, employment and output growth. Paradoxically, in the long-run equilibrium, a higher share of investment in human capital in output lowers the rate of human capital accumulation, with which output growth varies positively. A strengthening in the bargaining power of workers is output growth-enhancing in the long-run equilibrium, and it does so by raising the rates of accumulation of both physical and human capital.},

  abstract = {We develop a stock-flow consistent model to describe a macroeconomic system consisting of households, firms, the government, the central bank, and banks. The framework is based on the balance sheets of all sectors, in which the monetary flows between them govern the dynamics of the items. The whole system evolves over time and eventually attains a stationary state. Using this integrated model, we find that all flows from banks, including issuing loans, purchasing bonds, paying dividends, and paying interest on deposits, create money. On the contrary, all flows going to banks, including receiving repayments, selling bonds, issuing equities, and receiving interest on loans and bonds, lead to money destruction. These flows associated with the behaviors of money creation and destruction are the core factors that determine stationary states. We show the relationships between these flows and the stationary stock variables, especially the quantity of money. We also present the dependence of final output on these flows. We analyze the effects of monetary policies, such as changing the rate on loans and the amount of bank reserves. We find that an increase in the rate may yield higher output, while injecting more reserves may result in lower output.},

Design/Methodology/Approach: The Granger-Causality bootstrap rolling-window test is used for studying the causality between the stock as well as real estate markets in the US. Findings: The results provide robust evidence that the causality running from the housing in the stock markets has positive effects between 1918 and 1922, 1926 and 1931, 1953 and 1955 but negative effects between 1932 and 1934 and from 1971 to 1972, displaying the occurrence of a credit-price effect. In contrast, the S\&P 500 stomped the housing market between 1965 and 1970, when the wealth effect dominated in the US economy. Specifically, when the negative causality of both markets happens, investors gain by allocating housing and stocks assets as various portfolios. Practical Implications: This finding specifies that housing markets may be employed to predict stock markets and vice versa in the US. Studying both markets' causality offers policymakers and practitioners more situation on where the market may be going and how it works over time. Originality/Value: Original research.},

To determine whether a family is constrained by these criteria, the optimal home purchase price is estimated. The results indicate that wealth and income constraints both reduce homeownership propensities, with a stronger impact for wealth constraints. Mortgage market innovations of the early 1980s seem to have reduced these effects. The research indicates, however, that even in welldeveloped capital markets, the presence of borrowing constraints adversely affects homeownership propensities.},

  abstract = {Purpose From the perspective of cause and effect, the operational processes of property insurance companies can be considered as historical events. The purpose of this study is to measure the operating efficiency of China's property insurance industry, explore the determinants that affect technical efficiency and outline the path to achieving high-quality development. Design/methodology/approach We chose 44 Chinese property insurance companies as research objects. The data were obtained from the Chinese Insurance Yearbook and China Statistical Yearbook 2015\textendash 2017. First, the data envelopment analysis (DEA) method was used to calculate the technical efficiency of property insurance companies. Then, Tobit regression and quantile regression were adopted to explore the influencing factors of technical efficiency. Finally, the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) method was employed to summarize the path to improving the operating efficiency of property insurance companies. Findings The empirical results in the first stage suggested that the operation efficiency of China's property insurance industry was technically inefficient, and the scale efficiency was relatively better than the pure technical efficiency. In the second stage, we observed that the drivers for firm size, reinsurance rate, claim ratio and equity restriction were important determinants of an insurance firm's efficiency. Research limitations/implications We also put forward four applicable, targeted and proven ways to improve the technical efficiency of property insurance companies. These configurations are verified by cases of existing property insurance companies, which can provide practical references for the insurance industry. Originality/value Our research enriches the insurance literature and efficiency methods, particularly regarding the specific paths of improving the technical efficiency. The relationship between elements and results is analyzed from a systematic perspective, and the research results are not only more consistent with what logic might imply but also more instructive for the improvement of reality.},

The model is confronted with the U.S. macroeconomic time series. Our estimated model can account for two prominent facts observed in the data. First, the land price and the unemployment rate tend to move in opposite directions over the business cycle. Second, a shock that moves the land price is capable of generating large volatility in unemployment. Our estimation indicates that a 10 percent drop in the land price leads to a 0.34 percentage point increase of the unemployment rate (relative to its steady state).},

  abstract = {The final model ensures the idea that real estate variables are significantly correlated with GDP growth in Beijing. House pricing and real estate related services are indeed factors associated with GDP growth. The government policies restricting policies housing trade is affecting GDP growth. The regression results support the idea that a raise in real estate prices is correlated with the growth in GDP. However, increasing real estate prices are not always having a good outcome. It is hurting the economic growth in the long-term perspective. Several economists have predicted the collapse of asset prices in China. The primary reason is the unregulated loans given by Chinese banks which will result in a recession. Steps to boost the domestic demand of the Chinese population have to be taken by the Chines leaders. China's economy has an active consumer market which allows China to rely less on the exports and diversifying to other markets. This means that the nation should rely less on companies owned by the states and rely more on private owned companies to be in a competitive environment. President Xi came up with a 2025 economic plan which prioritizing industries like clean-energy, advanced technology, aircraft engine, and big data (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2014.) Raising prices in the real estate market would result in a lack of innovation power since most of the people chose to invest in housing. People put money into real estate that could otherwise go to newly established firms or industrial frontiers. With a lack of money support, firms may find it hard to survive. Also, overly investing in the real estate market will result in an asset bubble. The asset bubble will not only increase the stress of young adults and also increase the chance of potential recession. For further research, studying the real estate cycle of China will be more accurate in showing what exactly happened in China's economic growth.},

  abstract = {While national inequality has made headlines in recent years, income is far more unequally distributed globally than it is within any state. It is striking that global economic inequality has garnered so little attention in International Political Economy (IPE), given the field's longstanding interest in the distribution of resources and the structure of the global economy. This paper argues that IPE should regard the unequal global distribution of wealth and income as a central research concern and outlines a research agenda for doing so. Drawing on recent work by economists, it argues that global inequality is distinctively political in cause and consequence and sufficiently different from both global poverty and national inequality to constitute a unique object of inquiry. IPE has the theoretical and conceptual tools to study global inequality, but doing so will require bridging divisions between those who consider distributional consequences, though primarily in a national perspective, and those concerned with global hierarchies, but with less regard to national agency and economic policymaking. The effort is worth it, however, given the rich substantive agenda that foregrounding global inequality opens up on a series of topics that have not all (to date) been recognized as the core of the field.},

Against the background of increased corporate indebtedness, our interest is in quantifying contagion effects that endogenously arise from corporate defaults in a securitized credit portfolio. We calibrate the model to the U.S., where corporate credit securitization has been reintensified in recent years. Simulations deliver adverse medium- to long-term effects as soon as the share of securitized loans in total new loans economy-wide approaches 10\%. Securitization activities above this threshold lead to significant welfare losses from the medium-term onwards. Two transmission channels are conceivable. A collapsing special purpose vehicle (SPV) either causes distortions in the banking sector or increases liquidity constraints that ultimately dampen households' consumption due to their financial investment in the securitized tranches. A more concentrated banking sector reinforces the adverse shock of a liquidation of the SPV. In contrast, a faster and better-equipped bank rescue mechanism in the form of levies within the banking sector helps to contain the consequences of a SPV collapse.},

  abstract = {A complete guide to carrying out complex survey analysis usingR As survey analysis continues to serve as a core component ofsociological research, researchers are increasingly relying upondata gathered from complex surveys to carry out traditionalanalyses. Complex Surveys is a practical guide to theanalysis of this kind of data using R, the freely available anddownloadable statistical programming language. As creator of thespecific survey package for R, the author provides the ultimatepresentation of how to successfully use the software for analyzingdata from complex surveys while also utilizing the most currentdata from health and social sciences studies to demonstrate theapplication of survey research methods in these fields.The book begins with coverage of basic tools and topics withinsurvey analysis such as simple and stratified sampling, clustersampling, linear regression, and categorical data regression.Subsequent chapters delve into more technical aspects of complexsurvey analysis, including post-stratification, two-phase sampling,missing data, and causal inference. Throughout the book, anemphasis is placed on graphics, regression modeling, and two-phasedesigns. In addition, the author supplies a unique discussion ofepidemiological two-phase designs as well as probability-weightingfor causal inference. All of the book's examples and figures aregenerated using R, and a related Web site provides the R code thatallows readers to reproduce the presented content. Each chapterconcludes with exercises that vary in level of complexity, anddetailed appendices outline additional mathematical andcomputational descriptions to assist readers with comparing resultsfrom various software systems.Complex Surveys is an excellent book for courses onsampling and complex surveys at the upper-undergraduate andgraduate levels. It is also a practical reference guide for appliedstatisticians and practitioners in the social and health scienceswho use statistics in their everyday work.},

The models covered include vector autoregressive, cointegrated,vector autoregressive moving average, multivariate ARCH and periodic processes as well as dynamic simultaneous equations and state space models. Least squares, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods are considered for estimating these models. Different procedures for model selection and model specification are treated and a wide range of tests and criteria for model checking are introduced. Causality analysis, impulse response analysis and innovation accounting are presented as tools for structural analysis. The book is accessible to graduate students in business and economics. In addition, multiple time series courses in other fields such as statistics and engineering may be based on it. Applied researchers involved in analyzing multiple time series may benefit from the book as it provides the background and tools for their tasks. It bridges the gap to the difficult technical literature on the topic.},

The literature suggests that parties representing the economic `left' are more likely to advocate Keynesian measures, whereas parties representing the economic `right' tend to support the neoliberal ones. However, the current political discourse suggests that the choice of anti-crisis policies rather reflects the conflict of interests between euro states that received a bailout (debtors) and those who only provided financial guarantees (creditors). The empirical findings, based on (1) discourse analysis of national parliamentary debates and (2) the qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) model (crisp set), demonstrate that \textendash{} next to the economic stance of a party \textendash{} receipt of a bailout also accounts for parliamentary parties' positioning on anti-crisis measures. In particular, parliamentary parties in debtor states are likely to opt for Keynesian anti-crisis measures despite their right-wing economic stance or membership in the government.},

  abstract = {Agent-based modelling and simulation (ABMS) is a relatively new approach to modelling systems composed of autonomous, interacting agents. Agent-based modelling is a way to model the dynamics of complex systems and complex adaptive systems. Such systems often self-organize themselves and create emergent order. Agent-based models also include models of behaviour (human or otherwise) and are used to observe the collective effects of agent behaviours and interactions. The development of agent modelling tools, the availability of micro-data, and advances in computation have made possible a growing number of agent-based applications across a variety of domains and disciplines. This article provides a brief introduction to ABMS, illustrates the main concepts and foundations, discusses some recent applications across a variety of disciplines, and identifies methods and toolkits for developing agent models.},

The chapter reviews the cross-national evidence underpinning the emerging story of housingmarket-economy interactions across the advanced economies. It briefly considers whether the reductionism of the understanding developed is too great for many modeling and policy purposes. The chapter suggests ways to progress a better stylized synopsis of housing systems for cross-country modeling, so that housing systems design actually plays some role in explaining housing market outcomes. It considers some of the policy implications of the evidence to date but from the perspective of housing rather than monetary policies and notes emerging future challenges.

  abstract = {The panel data unit root test suggested by Levin and Lin (LL) has been widely used in several applications, notably in papers on tests of the purchasing power parity hypothesis. This test is based on a very restrictive hypothesis which is rarely ever of interest in practice. The Im\textendash Pesaran\textendash Shin (IPS) test relaxes the restrictive assumption of the LL test. This paper argues that although the IPS test has been offered as a generalization of the LL test, it is best viewed as a test for summarizing the evidence from a number of independent tests of the sample hypothesis. This problem has a long statistical history going back to R. A. Fisher. This paper suggests the Fisher test as a panel data unit root test, compares it with the LL and IPS tests, and the Bonferroni bounds test which is valid for correlated tests. Overall, the evidence points to the Fisher test with bootstrap-based critical values as the preferred choice. We also suggest the use of the Fisher test for testing stationarity as the null and also in testing for cointegration in panel data.},

In a stable case, these 'short-period' warranted rates converge to a unique 'long-period' warranted rate, this being determined independently of the rate of growth of autonomous demand. Thus one has a non-steady path of normal output growth. Different rates of growth of autonomous demand engender, for one and the same configuration of normal income distribution, different paths of normal output growth. Moreover, in a circulating-capital-only model with a given constant rate of growth of autonomous demand, different initial rates of growth in aggregate demand also produce different paths of normal output growth. These results point to the importance of effective demand in capital accumulation.},

  abstract = {What determines the rate of growth, the distribution of income, and the structure of relative prices under capitalism? What, in short, makes capitalist economies tick? This watershed treatise analyzes the answers to these questions provided by three major theoretical traditions: neoclassical, neo-Marxian, and neo-Keynesian. Until now, the mutual criticism exchanged by partisans of the different traditions has focused disproportionately on the logical shortcomings of rival theories, or on such questions as whether or not input-output relationships can be described by a continuous-substitution production function. In this book, these are at best secondary issues. The real distinguishing features of the theories, for Stephen Marglin, are their characterization of labor markets and capital accumulation. For clarity, Marglin first sets out the essential features of each theory in the context of a common production model with a single good and a fixed-coefficient technology. He then formalizes the different theories as alternative ways of closing the model. In subsequent chapters he examines the effects of relaxing key simplifying assumptions, in particular the characterization of technology and the homogeneity of output and capital. And although his primary emphasis is theoretical, he does not ignore the problem of empirically testing the theories. Finally, he synthesizes the insights of the neo-Marxian and neo-Keynesian models into a single model that transcends the shortcomings of each taken separately. Marglin anticipates that partisans of the different traditions will agree on one point: each will allow that the book reveals the shortcomings of the other theories but will insist that it fails utterly to reflect the power and majesty of one's own particular brand of truth. Growth, Distribution, and Prices will be controversial, but it will not be ignored.},

  abstract = {Business cycle dynamics can shape the wealth distribution through asset price changes, saving responses, or a combination of both. This paper studies the implications of housing booms and busts for wealth inequality, examining two episodes over the last four decades in Spain. I combine fiscal data with household surveys and national accounts to reconstruct the entire wealth distribution and develop a new asset-specific decomposition of wealth accumulation to disentangle the main forces behind wealth inequality dynamics (e.g., capital gains, saving rates). I find that the top 10\% wealth share drops during housing booms, but the decreasing pattern reverts during busts. Differences in capital gains across wealth groups appear to be the main drivers of the decline in wealth concentration during booms. In contrast, persistent differences in saving rates across wealth groups and portfolio reshuffling towards financial assets among top wealth holders are the main explanatory forces behind the reverting evolution during housing busts. I show that the heterogeneity in saving responses is largely driven by differences in portfolio adjustment frictions across wealth groups and that tax incentives can exacerbate this differential behavior. Using a novel personal income and wealth tax panel, I explore the role of tax incentives exploiting quasi-experimental variation created by a large capital income tax reform in a differencesin-differences setting. I find that capital income tax cuts, largely benefiting top wealth holders, explain on average 60\% of the increase in the top 10\% wealth share during the recent housing bust. These results provide novel empirical evidence to enrich macroeconomic theories of wealth inequality over the business cycle.},

Applications of the method have appeared in numerous journals. Recently, csQCA has been criticized concerning the validity of the models it generates as a result of the fact that it is unable to distinguish real from random data. It is argued that csQCA always identifies an explanatory model, even on the basis of random data. The paper addresses this hypothesis via a simulation. It uses randomly created datamatrices to show that csQCA can make a distinction between real and random data when model specification parameters are taken into account. First of all, the proportion of explanatory conditions on cases should be below a certain threshold, which differs as a function of the combination of conditions on cases. Secondly, there is an upper-limit to the number of explanatory conditions which can be used in a csQCA-analysis. The importance of the design parameters are the result of the problem of uniqueness which is a consequence of the use of Boolean algebra. Five implications for comparative case research-design and csQCA are discussed.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to address and test two assumptions on which csQCA is based, namely that csQCA will generate contradictions and low consistency scores if models are ill-specified. The first part of the paper introduces csQCA in general and as a stepwise approach. In a second part a real-life example is introduced with the purpose of illustrating how csQCA operates and as an input for a simulation in the subsequent part. The third part introduces contradictions, consistency, their interrelatedness and the assumptions which are made with regard to contradictions and consistency. Subsequently the assumptions are tested via a simulation on the basis of a csQCA analysis of over 5 million random datasets. The paper argues that researchers cannot always assume that csQCA will generate contradictions or low consistency scores when models are ill-specified. Such an assumption is only justified when csQCA applications take limitations with regard to model specification (the number of conditions and the number of cases) into account. Benchmark tables for model specification purposes are developed. Since these tables are based on a probability value of 0.5 the paper also tests the results for contradictions and consistency for the probabilities which were present in a real-life example. This test shows that the 0.5 probability generates an appropriate measure for the occurrence of contradictions and consistency indicating that the benchmark tables can be used for different applications with different distributions of 0's and 1's in the conditions and outcomes. The paper ends with a conclusion.},

Since its launch in 1987, QCA has been applied extensively in the social sciences. This review essay first sketches the origins of the ideas behind QCA. Next, the main features of the method, as presented in The Comparative Method, are introduced. A third part focuses on the early applications. A fourth part presents early criticisms and subsequent innovations. A fifth part then focuses on an era of further expansion in political science and presents some of the main applications in the discipline. In doing so, this paper seeks to provide insights and references into the origin and development of QCA, a non-technical introduction to its main features, the path travelled so far, and the diversification of applications.},

  abstract = {This article discusses `unconventional' monetary policy after the 2008 crisis. The focus is the original theoretical basis for such policy and possible Keynesian readings and criticisms. Drawing inspiration mainly from Keynes (1930; 1936) and Minsky (1975), the paper seeks to explain why ultra-low/negative interest rates neither caused `rentiers' to die, nor achieved full employment. The main hypothesis goes in the direction pointed to by Keynes: the problem is the low marginal efficiency of capital, the liquidity trap, and the lack of active government fiscal policy, which should be used in conjunction with monetary policy that maintains low long-term interest rates in order to spur investment. Monetary policy and very low/negative interest rates seem insufficient to overcome low growth. They are also incapable, at least in the short term, of promoting euthanasia of the rentiers as current monetary policy allows financial institutions to benefit from the capital gains it spurs.},

We investigate whether access to finance typically time-varies and, if so, what are the real effects. Consistent with time-varying external finance costs, both investment and employment are less sensitive to Tobin's q and more sensitive to cash flow during recessions and low investor sentiment periods. Share issuance plays a bigger role than debt issuance in causing these effects. Alternative tests that do not rely on q and cash flow sensitivities suggest that recessions and low sentiment increase external finance costs, thereby limiting investment and employment.},

This will be done through the cointegration analysis using the Johansen method. The results of the evaluation show that the demand components have permanent effects in the long run and that there is a positive causality from final demand autonomous components towards the product. Furthermore, an estimate of both the short and the long run dynamics through an Error-Correction Model is presented. Most empirical studies in which income is determined by demand work with exports-led model \`a la Thirlwall (1999, 2000). Instead, not only the exports but also both the government and the non-salaried private expenditures are included in this article.},

Previous studies have mostly discussed the net effect of a single factor on the economy, but it is more important to explore the combined effect of the combination of factors than that. The study uses fuzzy set qualitative comparison analysis (fsQCA) to test the multi-configuration relationship among innovative capability of technology, local market size, specialization of international division of labor and institutional context in 103 countries. The results prove that the scale of local market or innovative ability of technology can promote the development of developing countries' economy. Small countries with developed economies mostly develop their economy relying on science and technological innovation or institutional environment. Only large countries with strong comprehensive national strength and major economically developed countries often have both advantages of local market size and the innovative capability of technology. Based on the multi-path combination analysis, this article puts forward several suggestions for optimizing the path selection of economic development.},

  abstract = {Abstract Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) is a methodology for obtaining linguistic summarizations from data that are associated with cases. It was developed by the eminent social scientist Prof. Charles C. Ragin, but has, as of this date, not been applied by engineers or computer scientists. Unlike more quantitative methods that are based on correlation, fsQCA seeks to establish logical connections between combinations of causal conditions and an outcome, the result being rules that summarize the sufficiency between subsets of all of the possible combinations of the causal conditions (or their complements) and the outcome. The rules are connected by the word OR to the output. Each rule is a possible path from the causal conditions to the outcome. This paper, for the first time, explains fsQCA in a very quantitative way, something that is needed if engineers and computer scientists are to use fsQCA.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a new methodology for calibrating the fuzzy sets that are used in fsQCA, one that is based on clearly distinguishing between a linguistic variable and the linguistic terms for that variable, and that allows for uncertainties about those terms to be included in the calibration method. Each resulting fuzzy set, called an approximated reduced-information level 2 fuzzy set (RI L2 fuzzy set), is equivalent to a standard type-1 fuzzy set, but is for the linguistic variable, and, it has an S-shape, the kind of shape that is so widely used by fsQCA scholars, and is so important to fsQCA. This new calibration methodology is applied to Ragin's Breakdown of Democracy example, using new data provided by him, and demonstrates that his earlier solutions are also obtained using our approximated RI L2 fuzzy sets, something that should be reassuring to fsQCA scholars. Additionally, because the S-shaped membership functions are derived from footprints of uncertainty for all of the linguistic variable's terms, this paper shows how to obtain more precise statements of fsQCA causal combinations for their best instances, something that may be of added value to practitioners of fsQCA. Finally, we explain how different data-driven calibration robustness studies can be performed, something that may also be of great value to fsQCA practitioners.},

  abstract = {Evidence-driven agent-based modeling plays a useful part in understanding social phenomena. By integrating social-cognitive theories in our agent models, we bear evidence from social and psychological studies on our models for human decision-making. Social practice theory (SPT) provides a socio-cognitive theory that emphasizes three empirically and theoretically grounded aspects of behavior: habituality, sociality, and interconnectivity. Previous work has emphasized the importance of SPT for agents, has made abstract models of SPT, or used SPT to study energy systems. This article provides a set of requirements for integrating SPT in agent models and an evaluation of 11 current agent models with respect to these requirements. We find that current agent models do not fully capture habituality, sociality, or interconnectivity, nor is there a model that aims to integrate all three aspects. For example, current models do not support context-dependent habits, use a comprehensive set of collective concepts, and support hierarchies of activities. Our evaluation allows researchers to pick one of the current agent models depending on their needs regarding habituality, sociality, and interconnectivity. Furthermore, this article shows the usefulness of an agent model that integrates SPT and provides requirements that help modelers to achieve this model.},

  abstract = {Systematically combining quantitative and qualitative research approaches offers the potential for a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of social scientific phenomena. With their strong opportunities for building, qualifying, and testing social scientific theories, methodological integrations thus enable researchers to make substantive contributions that would not have been possible with one method alone. In this article we demonstrate how the integration of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) and conventional statistical analysis offers researchers new opportunities for contributing to the social sciences. Whereas statistical analysis is variable-oriented and relies on correlational analysis to make comparisons across cases, QCA is based on set theory, is case oriented, and relies on Boolean algebra to make comparisons between cases. Drawing on the literature on the interdependency between theoretical contribution and methodology, we review studies that integrate QCA and statistical analysis to explain how the specific combination of these two approaches allows researchers to strengthen the theoretical contribution of their research. From our review we identify common challenges and provide solutions for integrating QCA and statistical analysis.},

The indicator is high for the late 1980s, early 1990s and since the late 1990s. Finally, evidence based on panel data Granger causality tests suggests that house price changes are helpful in predicting changes in rents and vice versa.},

  abstract = {This paper presents new estimates on income concentration in Brazil over its development trajectory from 1933 to 2013 using individual tax records. The findings confirm Brazil's status as one of the world's most unequal countries, with concentration levels unrivalled elsewhere. Income has been highly concentrated at the top of the distribution, with the top 1 per cent amassing a share of 27 percent in 2013, and consistently fluctuating around 25 per cent since the mid 1970's. The majority of the income of the very rich in Brazil is not subject to the personal income tax, explaining their low tax liability and the difference between top shares of taxable income and top shares of total income, the latter registering much higher levels of concentration. We also present evidence that household surveys underestimate the extent of income inequality in Brazil. The overall findings illustrate the additional taxable capacity of top income groups, especially in a context where they are not investing as much in the productive capacities of the economy as their share of total income would justify.},

The model is estimated using national income accounts and capital stock data from 1929 to 1983. The conclusion is that the return to housing capital is about half that to non-housing capital and that the housing stock should be about 75\% of its 1983 volume.},

In the 1990s, qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) entered this research field but a tally shows that the number of democratization studies using this method has so far been low and there is little evidence of any take-off. We review a series of landmark studies that use explanatory typologies and 16 studies that use QCA to see how they fare on three criteria: alignment between hypotheses and methods, the strength of causal claims, and the employment of robustness tests. The review shows that most of the QCA applications devote too little attention to formulating set-theoretic propositions and to carrying out robustness tests. Moreover, many scholars are too quick to interpret their findings as causal relationships, especially in light of the modest use of within-case evidence. Finally, it is striking that virtually none of these analyses has influenced the literature in the way some of the studies combining simple explanatory typologies with within-case analysis have. Against this backdrop, we discuss the potential of QCA for democratization research.},

Accordingly, this study uses fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to identify the combinations of factors that lead to bank failure. The data consist of 30 annual financial ratio series for 156 U.S. banks over a 15-year period (2001\textendash 2015). Identifying combinations of conditions that can produce bank failure is crucial to help regulators and bank managers. The fsQCA presented in this paper sheds light on the relationships between combinations of conditions and bank failure, providing a solution comprising two sufficient and disjunctive sets of conditions that lead to bank failure. This solution includes financial indicators of performance, asset quality, efficiency and capitalisation. The robustness of the two sets of conditions is assessed using several tests.},

To some this would imply continuous full capacity utilization, which would require that demand adjusted itself to capacity. To others it would imply that investment is too sensitive to demand, generating instability. Recent developments, however, confirm that the model is fully compatible with flexible accelerator hypotheses and meets the conditions for demand led growth.},

Thirlwall, to the analysis of Mexico's economic growth in 1950-96.With the use of unit-root tests and cointegration analysis it estimates the long-run association between the growth of Mexico's real exports and real output in 1950-96, and selected subperiods. The results tend to show significant and positive cointegration between these two variables, thus giving support to the BPC-model as a relevant hypothesis to explain Mexico's long-term economic growth. Moreover, the findings of cointegration tests for selected subperiods suggest that the slowdown in its economic growth since 1982 is associated with an increase in the long-term income elasticity of imports that made more binding the balance-of-payments constraint on the expansion of domestic output.},

  abstract = {Many factors have contributed to the development of credit markets, easing access of households to credit. This paper considers the implications of easier credit for the influence of higher house prices on consumer expenditure. It argues that with poorly developed credit markets, the effect is likely to be negative, but becomes positive as access to housing collateral increases and down-payments for first time home buyers fall in relation to values. The implications for differences between countries and changes in consumer behaviour over time are explored. Previous studies are reviewed: the omission of credit liberalization and other controls has often biased estimates of housing 'wealth' effects on consumption. New empirical estimates for the UK and US suggest that there was no housing 'wealth effect' before credit market liberalization, but that the housing collateral effect is now significant, larger than the stock market wealth effect, and about twice as large in the US as the UK.},

However, model assessment, model comparison and replication are hampered to a large extent by a lack of transparency and comprehensibility in model descriptions. In this article we address the question of whether an ideal standard for describing models exists. We first suggest a classification for structuring types of model descriptions. Secondly, we differentiate purposes for which model descriptions are important. Thirdly, we review the types of model descriptions and evaluate each on their utility for the purposes. Our evaluation finds that the choice of the appropriate model description type is purpose-dependent and that no single description type alone can fulfil all requirements simultaneously. However, we suggest a minimum standard of model description for good modelling practice, namely the provision of source code and an accessible natural language description, and argue for the development of a common standard.},

The most basic problem is that these methods reduce causation to a logical relation and erroneously posit that causal hypotheses can be formalized as a relation of material implication. In addition, advocated of STCM commonly misrepresent their relationship to quantitative and qualitative methods. STCM and standard regression analysis are not incommensurable methods. Moreover, STCM actually clash with process tracing, a method used by qualitative researchers. Thus, qualitative comparativists should not use STCM, and the discussion about social science methods should turn from STCM to other, more promising options.},

Real estate funds (REIFs) and other housing investment firms leverage large-scale buy-to-rent investments in real estate assets that enable them to set prices in rental housing markets. A significant fraction of this funding is being provided in the form of non-bank lending (i.e., lending that is not subject to regulatory LTV limits). I develop a quantitative two-sector DSGE model that incorporates the main features of the real estate fund industry in the current context to study the effectiveness of dynamic LTV ratios as a macroprudential tool. Despite the comparatively low fraction of total property and debt held by REIFs, optimized LTV rules limiting the borrowing capacity of such funds are more effective in smoothing property prices, credit and business cycles than those affecting (indebted) households \textendash{} borrowing limit. This finding is remarkably robust across alternative calibrations (of key parameters) and specifications of the model. The underlying reason behind such an important and unexpectedly robust finding relates to the strong interconnectedness of REIFs with various sectors of the economy.},

Short-, medium- and long-run equilibria are considered. In the long-run case, the expectations of sales growth governing investment change adaptively, and this, combined with the autonomous growth rate of exports, produces convergence of the actual rate of capacity utilization to its normal rate. It is demonstrated that some aspects of the main Kaleckian results can be preserved not only in the short or medium run but also in the long run, in the sense that both (1) a decrease in the propensity to save, and (2) a change in income distribution favoring labor, bring about higher average rates of production growth and capital accumulation. However, the impact of a change in the profit share is shown to be subjected to the condition that the responsiveness of the real exchange rate with respect to the profit share has to be bounded from above, confirming that the scope for wage-led demand or wage-led growth can be limited by open-economy considerations, even within the supermultiplier context.},

The long-run version of the model converges conditionally to stable rates of employment and inflation, at the normal rate of capacity utilization. The model vindicates some of the main Keynesian or Kaleckian tenets, in the sense that an increase in the marginal propensity to save out of profits or in the bargaining power of firms generate lower average rates of capital accumulation and capacity utilization during the traverse.},

Moreover, most of the contributions that adopted the theoretical framework of Rodrik seem to disregard the profound transformations that have suffered developing economies in the last thirty years, as they accomplished a greater integration in financial markets, somehow at the detriment of the local productive structure (UNCTAD, 2018). This new evidence is likely to have undermined even more some of the potential channels through which this policy was supposed to operate. Our contribution aims at rethink the latter by constructing an analytical macro model based on Dvoskin, Feldman and Ianni (2018).

Both movements lasted until 2015. This work synthesizes the results of six papers, describing Brazilian income distribution trends and their close determinants. A common approach pursued looks jointly at inequality, mean, and social welfare growth rates. We use a vast array of data sets and empirical methodologies to fill the gaps found in the literature. Top incomes movements reduced income inequality fall but increased mean income growth, suggesting complex measurement and interpretation challenges. Overall, most of the inequality fall was driven by labour earnings, a channel dominated by firmspecific effects. Rising schooling and falling returns also played a key role, especially if parents' educational background is taken into account. Missing income values\textemdash or whether gross or disposable incomes concepts are used\textemdash did not affect inequality measures. Direct and indirect taxes increased inequality trends, while official monetary benefits did help, in particular conditional cash transfers. The Bolsa Familia programme was better targeted than all other transfers, most of which were linked to the Brazilian minimum wage.},

First, in the short run the role of autonomous expenditure can be appreciated within a standard post-Keynesian framework (Kaleckian, Kaldorian, Robinsonian, etc.). Second, and related to the first, the SSM model is a model of the long run and has to be evaluated as such. Third, in the long run, one way that capacity adjusts to demand is through an endogenous adjustment of the rate of utilization. Fourth, the SSM model is a peculiar way to reach what Garegnani called the " Second Keynesian Position. " Although, it respects the letter of the " Keynesian hypothesis, " it makes investment quasi-endogenous and subjects it to the growth of autonomous expenditure. Fifth, in the long run it is unlikely that " autonomous expenditure " is really autonomous. From a stock-flow consistent point of view this implies unrealistic adjustments after periods of changes in stock-flow ratios. Moreover, if we were to take this kind of adjustment at face value, there would be no space for Minskyan financial cycles. This also creates serious problems for the empirical validation of the model.},

We provide an exposition of the underlying theory of wage- and profit-led growth. We emphasize the implications of possible non-linearities in the determination of the final equilibrium and why\textemdash because of them\textemdash a redefinition of the concept of wage- and profit-led economy is necessary. We estimate the demand and distribution schedule for the US economy using a two-stage least squares approach. Our findings confirm the hypothesis of a non-linear distribution schedule and therefore the need to redefine the concepts wage- and profit-led growth.},

  abstract = {The critique by Gahn and Gonzalez (2019) of the conclusions in Nikiforos (2016) regarding what data should be used to evaluate whether capacity utilization is endogenous to demand is weak for the following reasons: (i) The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) measure of utilization is not appropriate for measuring long-run variations of utilization because of the method and purpose of its construction. Even if its difference from the measures of the average workweek of capital (AWW) were trivial, this would still be the case; if anything, it would show that the AWW is also an inappropriate measure. (ii) Gahn and Gonzalez choose to ignore the longest available estimate of the AWW produced by Foss, which has a clear long-run trend. (iii) Their econometric results are not robust to more suitable specifications of the unit root tests. Under these specifications, the tests overwhelmingly fail to reject the unit root hypothesis. (iv) Other estimates of the AWW, which were not included in Nikiforos (2016) confirm these conclusions. v) For the comparison between the AWW series and the FRB series, they construct variables that are not meaningful because they subtract series in different units. When the comparison is done correctly, the results confirm that the difference between the AWW series and the FRB series has a unit root. (vi) A stationary utilization rate is not consistent with any theory of the determination of capacity utilization. Even if demand did not play a role, there is no reason to expect that all the other factors that determine utilization would change in a fashion that would keep utilization constant.},

The model incorporates an active banking sector and pays particular attention to the leverage of both firms and banks. It is shown that the endogenous change in the desired margins of safety of firms and banks is likely to transform an otherwise stable debt-burdened economy into an unstable one. The endogeneity of the desired margins of safety can also produce, under certain conditions, investment and leverage cycles during which investment and leverage move both in the same and in the opposite direction. Furthermore, the paper investigates the potential stabilising role of fiscal policy. It is indicated that fiscal policy can reduce the destabilising forces in the macroeconomy when government expenditures adjust adequately to variations in the divergence between the actual and the desired margins of safety.},

The results from simulation experiments provide support to the view that the combination of risky financial practices with wage stagnation can increase the likelihood of financial instability in a macro system.},

  abstract = {We analyse the interaction of demand and income distribution in a dynamic Kaleckian model with endogenous natural output. Endogenous changes of the natural output level to changes in the demand-determined actual output level have featured prominently in discussions of hysteresis after the crisis of 2008. We consider wage-led and profit-led demand (PLD) regimes and goods market-led and labour market-led income distribution regimes. The stability of the steady state is related to the endogeneity of natural output level in certain regimes. Limit cycles arise when the strong flexibility of prices or wages to the output gap is combined with moderate natural output hysteresis. A Kaleckian model with a wage-led demand regime and anticyclical profit share is less unstable and pseudo-Goodwin cycles can arise in the PLD regime with a procyclical profit share.},

  abstract = {R\'ESUM\'E Recent House Price Developments: The Role of Fundamentals In the vast majority of OECD economies, house prices in real terms have been moving up strongly since the mid-1990s. Because of the important role housing wealth has been playing during the current upswing, this paper will look more closely at what is underlying these developments for 18 OECD countries over the period from 1970 to the present, with a view to shedding some light on whether or not prices are in line with fundamentals. The paper begins by putting the most recent housing price run-ups in the context of the experiences of the past 35 years. It then examines current valuations against a range of benchmarks. It concludes with a review of the links between a possible correction of housing prices and real activity. The main highlights from this analysis are as follows: 1) The size and duration of the current real house price increases; the degree to which they have tended to move together across countries; and the extent to which they have disconnected from the business cycle are unprecedented. 2) Overvaluation of real house prices may only apply to a relatively small number of countries. However, the extent to which these prices look to be fairly valued depends largely on longer-term interest rates remaining at or close to their current low levels. 3) If house prices were to adjust downward, the historical record suggests that the drops might be large and that the process could be protracted, given the observed stickiness of nominal house prices and the current low rates of inflation.},

This paper also argues and presents evidence that these two schools of thought began and continue to be very distinct in nature. It is then argued that despite several fundamental differences, a perceptible shift in interest can be observed on the part of some academics away from the New Keynesian approach and towards the Post-Keynesian approach since the opening of the financial crisis. Additional evidence of this change is presented at the international level and within one particular Bretton Woods institution, the International Monetary Fund.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between construction activity and economic development at the provincial level in the Peoples' Republic of China. It also examines variations in the mix of construction outputs among the provinces as they achieve increasing levels of development. It is argued that the analysis of provincial construction outputs and levels of economic development provides additional insights into the debate on the wider relationship between construction activity and economic development as posited by Turin in his seminal studies during the 1960s and 1970s. Since these seminal works many researchers have also sought to explain the relationship between construction activity and economic development. Turin's model is of this relationship and although some studies only provide qualified support for this hypothesis, it is generally agreed that there is a causal link between construction activity and economic development within countries as they develop their economies. Most of these studies have been based on the use of international cross-sectional data from countries at different stages of development to infer an assumed relationship within an individual country over time. In this study, similar data are analyzed to examine these relationships at the provincial level within a large country, each of these provinces being at significantly differing levels of development. Since it adopted policies of economic reform in the late 1970s, China has realized considerable economic progress. However, this has varied significantly among the provinces and regions. Consequently, data demonstrating developments in China's wider economy and its construction activity at the provincial level can be used to test the applicability of the Turin hypothesis within a country that has undergone significant developments over such a short period of time.},

Starting from the annual series of immovable property tax revenues, we isolate years of significant shifts in the property tax regime and study their impact on house prices. We find a strong negative relationship between increases in immovable property tax revenues and house prices. This relationship is robust to the inclusion of cyclical determinants of house prices, country and year fixed effects, and country-specific linear trends. We also propose an instrumental variable strategy based on countries' legal origins that confirms a statistically significant negative impact of such taxes in the short run.},

  abstract = {We addressed two shortcomings in the existing studies that focused on the association between students' academic performance (SAP) and their mobile phone use behaviors (MPUB) in this study by conducting a self-report, student-based cross-sectional study in two Nigerian universities between February and March 2014. We collected the data for the study from 286 students in the two universities using a convenience-based sampling approach. The data were analyzed using fsQCA version 2.0 and hierarchical linear (blocked) regression (HLR). The HLR results reveal that time spent calling on phone was the only significant predictor of SAP out of the seven MPUB variables (addiction, distraction, dependence, multitasking, time spent calling, time spent using social networking sites and perception on the effect of MPUB on SAP) considered. It further revealed that students' hours of study per day explains more of the variations in SAP than their MPUB. More so, none of the MPUB variables individually meets the minimum consistency score of .85, indicating that no single MPUB variable is by itself sufficient to influence SAP. However, implementing the MPUB variables as a configuration reveals that there are three pathways to attaining high academic achievements. The major finding of the present study suggests that combining several MPUB variables may be more effective than focusing on individual MPUB variables when investigating the relationship between SAP and their MPUB.},

  abstract = {The delivery of post-disaster shelter assistance continues to be fraught with challenges derived from the coordination of resources, involvement of project stakeholders, and training of households and builders. There is a need to better understand what project elements in the delivery of post-disaster shelter projects most influence resilience and sustainability. To address this need, we examined nineteen post-disaster shelter projects in the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan. We first characterized coordination, participation, and training employed across the planning, design, and construction phases of shelter projects and then used fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to assess the influence of these elements, alone and in combination, on building resilient and sustainable community infrastructure systems. Findings show that early involvement of households in planning efforts, combined with subsequent training, was important in evolving recovery outcomes. Our results point to the importance of: (1) supporting household sheltering processes over delivering hard products; (2) strategically linking project processes across phases; and (3) aligning humanitarian actions with long-term development. Conclusions from this study contribute to theory of sheltering in developing communities and more broadly to theory of recovery processes that link to community resilience and sustainability.},

Public investment multipliers estimated for Brazil may reach high values during recessions (above 2) and much lower values in booms (at most 0.8).

A realiza\c{c}\~ao de uma contra\c{c}\~ao fiscal no meio de uma recess\~ao foi, contudo, decorr\^encia da "perda de espa\c{c}o fiscal" causada pela tend\^encia de redu\c{c}\~ao do resultado prim\'ario estrutural observada desde 2007.

The term is a catch-all phrase used to denote important changes in the structure of nonfinancial corporations' balance sheets, including the growth of income from financial subsidiaries and investment as well as growth in the transfer of earnings to financial markets in the forms of interest payments, dividend payments and stock buybacks. This paper seeks to empirically explore the relationship between financialization in the U.S economy and real investment at the firm level. Using data from a sample of non-financial corporations from 1973 to 2003, I find a negative relationship between real investment and financialization. First, increased financial investment and increased financial profit opportunities may have crowded out real investment by changing the incentives of firm managers and directing funds away from real investment. Second, increased payments to the financial markets may have impeded real investment by decreasing available internal funds, shortening the planning horizons of the firm management, and increasing uncertainty. These two channels can help explain the negative relationship I find between investment and financialization.},

  abstract = {It is a well-known fact that the housing market, with its associated mortgage securities, plays a crucial role in modern economies. The recent crisis of 2007, triggered by the U.S. real estate bubble, confirms this key role and suggests the importance of regulating mortgage lending. This paper investigates these issues by designing a housing market with a linked mortgage lending instrument in the Eurace agent-based model. Our results show that the presence of a housing market in the model has relevant macroeconomic implications, driven mainly by the additional amount of endogenous money injected into the economy by new mortgages. This additional money generally helps to support and stabilize aggregated demand, thus improving the main economic indicators. However, if the regulation of mortgage lending is too lax, involving an increase in the debt-service-to-income ratio (DSTI), then the additional supply of mortgages no longer enhances macroeconomic performance, and the stability of the economic system is undermined. Based on a number of recent discussions, a regulation of stock control that targets households' net wealth (a stock), rather than income (a flow) is designed and analyzed. The results show that regulation of stock control can be combined effectively with DSTI to increase the stability of the housing market and the economy as a whole. Interestingly, the regulation based on stock control also directly affects mortgage distribution among households, avoiding excessive concentration. From a policy perspective, our results suggest that the use of a mild flow control regulation, coupled with a stricter stock control measure, fosters sustainable growth and eases first-time buyers access to the housing market, encouraging homeownership.},

In this study, we focus on financial contagion due to debt exposure and structural concentration at interbank networks. Our results suggest that a medium density of connections in regular networks is already sufficient to induce a 'robust-yet-fragile' response to insolvency shocks, while the same occurs in star networks only when the centralization is very high. The simulation model enables us to create stock-flow-consistent interbank networks with desired level of network connectivity and centralization. A parsimonious set of network configuration parameters can be employed not only to create stylized network structures with exact connectivity and centralization features but also random core-periphery network representations of a two-tier banking system. Our generic setup decouples the steps of a research on financial contagion. The layers of the simulator covers phases of a research from interbank network configuration to probing the details of a contagion. The presented version enables researchers (i) to create an interbank system of a desired network structure, (ii) to initialize bank balance sheets where the network in previous step can optionally be used as an input, (iii) to configure a controlled or randomized sequence of exogenous shock vectors, (iv) to simulate and inspect detailed process of a single contagion process via tables, graphs and plots generated by the simulator, (v) to design and run automated Monte Carlo simulations, (vi) to analyze results of Monte Carlo simulations via tools from the simulation analysis library.},

Concerns related to supply, particularly at the higher segment of the market, lead these discussions. In this respect, basic regression estimations indicate that over the post-2010 period, income elasticity of house price changes is negative, despite housing being a normal good. In order to reveal the underlying reason, we discuss the role of income distribution. Our empirical analyses suggest that the share of bottom (the top) income quintiles are positively (is negatively) correlated with house price changes. Given the current ample stock of houses, at the high-end of the market, a demand surge led by an increase in the income share of the top income quintile may not put pressure on house prices. In addition, the declining income share of bottom three income quintiles may lead to a reduction in their housing demand. Thus, policies directed to improving income equality might help mitigate the imbalances in the housing market.},

  abstract = {Qualitative comparative analysis was initially time-agnostic, but efforts to make the method more time-sensitive have been made since the mid-2000s. These attempts mainly focus on cross-case differences, accounting for change over time at the level of attributes or conditions. While useful, they cannot account for the fact that individual cases also develop over time. As such, strategies regarding `within-case' development have remained under-theorized in qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). To address this gap, we propose trajectory-based qualitative comparative analysis (TJ-QCA) building on the logic of the diversityoriented approach: meaningful within-case change is carefully defined in terms of development stages that capture qualitative case-based change patterns. We conceptualize configurations dynamically so that they express different development stages. Theoretically, our method is rooted in a complexity-informed understanding of cases describing trajectories through the property space. Trajectory-based qualitative comparative analysis works with both numerical and qualitative data. We will illustrate the method empirically by re-elaborating a well-known published time-sensitive qualitative comparative analysis study.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the time-series and micro-econometric evidence on the relationship between stock and house prices and consumer spending. The time-series studies distinguish between short-run and long-run links between consumption, income and wealth. They allow us to identify which variables adjust to restore the long-run equilibrium in the case of a shock, and to determine the time taken by the adjustment process. The micro-econometric literature improves our understanding of the link between wealth and expenditure and distinguishes among the alternative hypotheses \textendash{} of direct wealth effect, common causality and collateral channel \textendash{} that have been proposed to explain this relationship. The relationship between wealth and consumer spending appears to be strong, but there is some disagreement as to its size and nature. Furthermore, there appear to be some important differences across countries, which should be allowed for by policy makers when appraising the policy implications of a change in asset prices.},

It explores the channels whereby functional and personal income distribution impact growth. The growth\textendash inequality relationship can be negative or positive, depending on the economy's characteristics. Contrary to widespread claims, inequality per se does not impact growth through macroeconomic channels. Instead, both growth and inequality are impacted by changes in the underlying forms and pattern of income payments. However, inequality is critical at the microeconomic level as it explains differences in household propensities to consume which are at the foundation of neo-Kaleckian and Cambridge growth theory.},

  abstract = {This article examines distributional disparities within nations. There are six main conclusions. First, about 80 per cent of the world's population now lives in regions whose median country has a Gini close to 40. Second, as outliers are now only located among middle-income and rich countries, the `upwards' side of the `Inverted-U' between inequality and income per capita has evaporated (and with it the hypothesis that posits that `things have to get worse before they can get better'). Third, among middle-income countries, Latin America and mineral-rich Southern Africa are uniquely unequal, while Eastern Europe follows a distributional path similar to the Nordic countries. Fourth, among rich countries there is a large (and growing) distributional diversity. Fifth, within a global trend of rising inequality, there are two opposite forces at work. One is `centrifugal' and leads to an increased diversity in the shares of the top 10 per cent and bottom 40 per cent. The other is `centripetal' and leads to a growing uniformity in the income-share appropriated by deciles 5 to 9. Therefore, half of the world's population (the middle and upper-middle classes) have acquired strong `property rights' over half of their respective national incomes; the other half of this income, however, is increasingly up for grabs between the very rich and the poor. And sixth, globalization is thus creating a distributional scenario in which what really matters is the income-share of the rich (because the rest `follows').},

  abstract = {The paper deals with the influence of the size of financial industry on income distribution. In opposition to Piketty's position, it argues that the wage share is influenced by changes in the size of the sectors of the economy, by the input composition of the productive structure and by the ability of the workers to capture the increases in productivity. The process of financialization experienced in the recent decades has affected these three elements. Among other things, it has enhanced the ability of the banking industry to affect the formation of monetary policy and legislation, which in turn can have had some bearing on the workers' ability to appropriate the increases in productivity. After describing Piketty's interpretation of the rise in inequality and discuss his views on the theories of distribution, the paper illustrates different representations of the financial sector proposed by the literature, underlining the relevance of considering this sector as an industry. By following these lines the paper describes how an enlarged size of the banking industry can increase inequality.},

It presents a linear production model where a banking industry is introduced and argues that changes in the size of the financial industry can change the distributive shares even if the rates of profit and wage remain constant. An increase in the new loans to workers can increase the profit share and reduce the wage share through an increase in effective demand and the level of production. The analysis can support the contention that the process of financial deregulation, with the consequent explosion of the financial system and the rise of systemic risk, is at the basis of the increase in income inequality observed in recent years.},

This Strategic Analysis considers the recent trajectory, the present state, and the future prospects of the US economy. The authors identify four main structural problems that explain how we arrived at the crisis of 2007-09 and why the recovery that has followed has been so weak-as well as why the prospect of a recession is increasingly likely. The US economy is in need of deep structural reforms that will deal with these problems. This report analyzes a pair of policies that begin to move in that direction, both involving an increase in the tax rate for high-income and high-net-worth households. Even if the primary justification for these policies is not economic, this report shows that if such an increase in taxes is accompanied by an equivalent increase in government outlays, the redistributive impact will have a positive macroeconomic effect while moving the US economy toward a more sustainable future.},

Using Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), the study examines the complex relations among job vulnerability, disposable income for tourism, marketing activities, and price and quality issues for Greek holiday makers returning from their vacations. The article also compares QCA with the two dominant linear methods of analysis (i.e. correlation and regression) and highlights the suitability of QCA when dealing with complexity in tourism. The results reveal four configurations explaining the attributes of Greek residents' tourism decisions, characterized by value-for-money orientation, achievement of best available purchase, psychological strengthening, and price sensitivity. The study also employs predictive validity for the presented models. The findings are valid from both a methodological and managerial perspective suggesting new research insights.},

Given this popularity, in the related literature it is often claimed that the only open question left is an empirical one: to assess econometrically whether a particular economy is wage- or profit-led.

(2017) revive an old proposal for solving this problem \textendash{} making the rate of normal utilization an endogenous variable that converges to the actual utilization rate \textendash{} justifying it with new premises, based on a recent contribution to production theory (Nikiforos 2013). In this note, we argue that their proposed adjustment mechanism is based on restrictive assumptions, some of which have little economic justification. Moreover, we show that also if one puts aside for the sake of argument the perplexities regarding the `endogenization' of the normal rate of utilization, the existence of autonomous components of demand is sufficient to invalidate their results.},

  abstract = {How capital openness influences the wage-setting process is a topic that has been discussed extensively in the literature on European industrial relations. One well-known hypothesis asserts that high capital openness induces employers to de-coordinate the wage-setting process, if wage costs have been under poor control. This article provides a critical review of the hypothesis, arguing that it holds only if governments can provide flexible accommodating policies for employers during the period of institutional transition. If such policy options are not available, which is true when governments are committed to European monetary integration, the hypothesis does not hold. This claim is tested with a Boolean qualitative analysis of 11 European countries, focusing on the periods from the 1970s to early 2000s.},

  abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to show how a simple (medium-scale) empirical stock-flow consistent dynamic model can be developed from scratch. Eurostat data and conventional statistical packages (notably EViews, Excel and R) are used. On the theoretical side, the work builds upon the pioneering work by Godley and Lavoie (2006)[5]. Sectoral transaction flows and balance sheets are explicitly modelled and their evolution over non-ergodic time under different scenarios is analysed. The model also draws upon the applied work by Burgess et al. (2016)[2]. The case of Italy is considered, but the model can be easily extended to other countries. Eurostat annual data (from 1995 to 2016) are used to estimate most of model parameter values (e.g. consumption function and housing investment parameters). Remaining parameters are borrowed from the available literature or taken from a range of realistic values (e.g. weight on past errors in agents' expectations). The model is then used to impose and compare alternative scenarios for Italian sectoral financial balances, based on different shocks to government spending.},

  abstract = {Introdu\c{c}\~ao este momento da hist\'oria brasileira, falar de sa\'idas para a crise econ\^o-mica implica considerar duas ordens de fatores que se colocam como pressupostos, a primeira de ordem mais geral, e a segunda mais atinente \`a quest\~ao econ\^omica ou socioecon\^omica propriamente dita. Farei r\'apida men-\c{c}\~ao \`a primeira nesta introdu\c{c}\~ao e, na sequ\^encia, tratarei de modo mais acurado, ainda que brevemente, da segunda. A consuma\c{c}\~ao do golpe de Estado que destituiu a presidenta eleita Dilma Rousseff em agosto de 2016 agregou \`a crise econ\^omica e social j\'a em curso uma crise pol\'itico-institucional de largas propor\c{c}\~oes, com seguidos conflitos e bate-cabe\c{c}as entre os poderes constitu\'idos. \`Aquelas alturas, j\'a est\'avamos com o sexto trimestre seguido de queda no PIB, com o desemprego se elevando em velocidade escalar e com tens\~oes sociais crescentes decorrentes n\~ao s\'o da inseguran\c{c}a de renda, que passa a atingir parcela substantiva da popula\c{c}\~ao, mas tamb\'em das dificuldades or\c{c}ament\'arias de estados e munic\'ipios, com sal\'arios de servidores em atraso e colapso dos servi\c{c}os p\'ublicos. A destitui\c{c}\~ao da presidenta sem efetivo crime de responsabilidade, vis-ta como golpe por boa parte do mundo, inclusive pela imprensa internacional conservadora, explicitou a ilegitimidade dos novos donos do poder, de pronto associada \`as seguidas e reiteradas den\'uncias de corrup\c{c}\~ao envolvendo n\~ao s\'o o mandat\'ario mor, como praticamente todo o primeiro escal\~ao do governo. Diante esse quadro, a tese de que o impeachment seria a varinha m\'agica capaz de restaurar expectativas, recuperar o investimento e fazer renascer o cres-cimento econ\^omico, tese em si bastante discut\'ivel, foi rapidamente desmentida, em meio a um cen\'ario de elevada rotatividade dos mais altos quadros governa-mentais, desobedi\^encia a ordens judiciais e disputas sobre quem legisla, quem manda e quem julga. N\~ao \'e preciso grande esfor\c{c}o para perceber que, nesse cen\'ario de degrada\c{c}\~ao, com o grau de incerteza que arrasta consigo, o inves-timento privado n\~ao retomaria de imediato por for\c{c}a da mera substitui\c{c}\~ao da chefe do executivo (substitui\c{c}\~ao, de resto, apoiada indistintamente por todas as elites do pa\'is, incluindo-se a\'i a elite econ\^omica, produtiva e/ou rentista). 1 Instalado o caos, a crise pol\'itica passa a contar como elemento adicional de deteriora\c{c}\~ao do quadro econ\^omico, que, por sua vez, agrava ainda mais a tens\~ao e a desordem pol\'itico-institucional, num c\'irculo vicioso digno do inferno N\~ao h\'a sa\'ida sem a revers\~ao da financeiriza\c{c}\~ao LEDA MARIA PAULANI I N 10.1590/s0103-40142017.31890004 ESTUDOS AVAN\c{C}ADOS 31 (89), 2017 30 de Dante.

The crisis occurred just as the surge in housing starts that began in the late 1990s had reached a new historical zenith. This chapter explains the impact of the credit crunch on the Spanish housing market and in particular examines the evidence about how new supply reacted to the external shock. In support of this task it compares and contrasts housing supply elasticities in different Spanish regions over time. The analysis maintains that the strong expansion on housing supply was possible due to the flexibility of the development sector showing a high elasticity of new housing supply. Such flexibility it is argued is also the reason for the strong fall in housing construction as well as the tiny reduction in prices following the financial crisis.},

  abstract = {Abstract. What are the main variations in the constitutional control of the executive in 45 parliamentary democracies and how can these differences be accounted for? Four competing hypotheses, based on dichotomies, explain the degree of this control by means of contrasting institutional settings: consensus democracy versus majoritarian democracy, presidentialism versus parliamentarism, thick versus thin constitutionalism and established versus new democracies. These hypotheses are tested with the help of fuzzy-sets that allow for varying degrees of membership that go beyond the presence/absence suggested by these dichotomies. The necessary and sufficient conditions for constitutional control are specified with the help of this new methodology. The fuzzy-set analysis shows that the degree of constitutional control can be explained solely by a specific combination of institutional conditions stemming from the four dichotomies, and not by one single dimension. This constellation remains hidden for the traditional correlational techniques like regression. Hence, the fuzzy-set logic presents a promising new tool for comparativists that can be used to reveal causalities.},

We adopt the methodology of Girardi and Pariboni (2016) and extend it to a panel framework. We apply panel unit root, cointegration, and causality tests that are robust to endogenous regressors, cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity across countries. Our results are supportive of the Sraffian supermultiplier model. In a heterogeneous panel framework, autonomous demand and output follow a long-run equilibrium relationship and there exists panel long-run causality that goes unidirectionally from autonomous demand to output. We also empirically verify the investment accelerator (the mechanism that enables the dynamic stability of the model) by confirming the existence of same-sign panel causality running unidirectionally from the growth rate of autonomous demand to the investment share. Our results call for national economic policies aimed at promoting the components of autonomous demand that act as locomotives of growth in each country.},

We find evidence of symmetric and asymmetric frequency-domain Granger causality running unidirectionally from residential investment (RES) to output. This unidirectional causal relationship is both permanent and transitory: transitory shocks in RES have transitory effects on GDP, while permanent shocks in RES have permanent effects on GDP.

Our findings can also be read through the lenses of the recent autonomous demand-led growth literature. In particular, we single out a specific component of autonomous demand and describe its prominent role in the US variety of capitalism. Thus, we conclude that residential investment, despite constituting a small overall share of GDP, is not only the cycle but is also the trend of the US economy.},

Models of fixed-rate versus adjustable-rate, loan term, and prepayment and default decisions are introduced. This section is followed by an overview of the role of psychological factors on mortgage decision processes, such as financial knowledge and information search behavior. Several decision-making principles are presented that may affect borrowers' attention to and evaluation of mortgage products, including cognitive miserliness, decision heuristics such as hyperbolic discounting, framing and mental accounting, and biases in decision-making, such as status quo and loss aversion. In addition, several important contextual influences on mortgage decisions are discussed, including lender marketing activities and the regulatory environment. Finally, marketplace conditions that warrant consumer protection in mortgage markets are explained, along with a description of recent regulatory efforts of the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. An important conclusion is that no extant model fully incorporates all the economic, behavioral, and situational variables that are relevant to actual mortgage borrowing decisions.},

The proposed tests are based on average of pair-wise correlation coefficients of the OLS residuals from the individual regressions in the panel, and can be used to test for cross section dependence of any fixed order p, as well as the case where no a priori ordering of the cross section units is assumed, referred to a CD(p) and CD tests, respectively. Asymptotic distribution of these tests are derived and their power function analysed under different alternatives. It is shown that these test are correctly centred for fixed N and T, and are robust to single or multiple breaks in the slope coefficients and/or error variances. The small sample properties of the tests have the correct size in very small samples and satisfactory power, and as predicted by the theory, quite robust to the presence of unit roots and structural breaks. The use of the CD test is illustrated by applying it to study the degree of dependence in per capital output innovations across countries within a given region and across countries in different regions. The results show significant evidence of cross dependence in output innovations across many countries and regions of the world.},

It is shown that the centering of the LM statistic is correct for fixed T and N. Importantly, the proposed bias-adjusted LM test is consistent even when the Pesaran's (2004) CD test is inconsistent. Also an alternative bias-adjusted LM test, which is consistent under local error cross-section dependence of any fixed order p, is proposed. The finite sample behavior of the proposed tests is investigated and compared to that of the LM and CD tests. It is shown that the bias-adjusted LM tests successfully control the size, maintaining satisfactory power in panel with exogenous regressors and normal errors. However, it is also shown that the bias-adjusted LM test is not as robust as the CD test to non-normal errors and/or in the presence of weakly exogenous regressors.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a standardized version of Swamy's test of slope homogeneity for panel data models where the cross section dimension (N) could be large relative to the time series dimension (T). The proposed test, denoted by {$\Delta$}\texttildelow, exploits the cross section dispersion of individual slopes weighted by their relative precision. In the case of models with strictly exogenous regressors, but with non-normally distributed errors, the test is shown to have a standard normal distribution as (N,T) \textrightarrow j{$\infty$} such that N/T2\textrightarrow 0. When the errors are normally distributed, a mean-variance bias adjusted version of the test is shown to be normally distributed irrespective of the relative expansion rates of N and T. The test is also applied to stationary dynamic models, and shown to be valid asymptotically so long as N/T\textrightarrow{$\kappa$}, as (N,T)\textrightarrow j{$\infty$}, where 0{$\leqslant\kappa<\infty$}. Using Monte Carlo experiments, it is shown that the test has the correct size and satisfactory power in panels with strictly exogenous regressors for various combinations of N and T. Similar results are also obtained for dynamic panels, but only if the autoregressive coefficient is not too close to unity and so long as T{$\geqslant$}N.},

We analyse the distributional effects of such a macroprudential policy on mortgage and house price cycles. For identification, we exploit the universe of UK mortgages and a 15\%-limit imposed in 2014 on lenders \textemdash{} not households \textemdash{} for high loan-to-income ratio (LTI) mortgages. Despite some regulatory arbitrage (eg increases in LTV and average loan size), more-constrained lenders issue fewer high-LTI mortgages. Partial substitution by less-constrained lenders leads to overall credit contraction to low-income borrowers in local-areas more exposed to constrained-lenders, lowering house price growth. Following the Brexit referendum (which led to house-price correction), the 2014-policy strongly implies \textemdash{} via lower pre-correction debt \textemdash{} better house prices and mortgage defaults during an episode of house price correction.},

  abstract = {One of the earliest works on the economic significance of the construction industry and its role within the national economy was undertaken by Duccio A. Turin, then London Master Builders' Association Professor of Building at the Building Economics Research Unit, University College London. The quantitative relationships between construction and other important indicators of economic development were depicted for the first time by Turin in 1969. This has since then become one of the most frequently quoted works on the subject. Turin's findings were also adopted subsequently by major international agencies assigned with the task of resolving the problem of underdevelopment in the developing countries. Since Turin's studies some two decades ago, there has so far been no attempt to update the construction-development paradigm along the same format using statistical data sourced from the 1970s and 1980s. For the past 20 years most researchers appear to have assumed that Turin's findings will be `more-or-less' valid. While this supposition may be true to a certain extent, there will inevitably be some discrepancies when Turin's findings are analysed in the modern day context, where technological innovations and the completion of most of the required buildings and infrastructural facilities are expected to exert an influence on the existing relationship between construction and economic development. While this relationship still appears to be valid today, the degree or intensity with which construction and development link may, however, shift from the original quantitative models suggested by Turin. The extent of this suggested shift over time is, however, unknown despite the large number of research studies which have purportedly explored the relationship between construction and economic development over the last two decades. In view of this lacuna, this paper will attempt to replicate Turin's original paradigm for construction and development using data sourced from the 1970s and 1980s.},

Although they find that fiscal policy measures have so far neutralized the impact of the crisis with respect to income inequality, the existence of structural inequalities along racial lines in particular have resulted in an unequally shared public health burden. Broader policy changes are necessary for addressing dimensions of inequality that are rooted in structural racism.},

  abstract = {The rigidity of mortgage contracts and a variety of frictions in the design of the market and the intermediation sector hindered efforts to restructure or refinance household debt in the aftermath of the financial crisis. In this paper, we focus on understanding the design and implementation challenges of ex ante and ex post debt relief solutions that are aimed at a more efficient sharing of aggregate risk between borrowers and lenders. Using a simple framework that builds on the mortgage design literature, we illustrate that ex ante\textendash designed, automatically indexed mortgages and policies can facilitate a quick implementation of debt relief during a crisis. However, the welfare benefits of such solutions are substantially reduced if there are errors in understanding the underlying structure of income and housing risk and their relation to the indexes on which these solutions are based. Empirical evidence reveals significant spatial heterogeneity and the time-varying nature of the distribution of economic conditions, which pose a significant challenge to the effective ex ante design of such solutions. The design of ex post debt relief policies can be more easily fine-tuned to the specific realization of economic risk. Howe\- ver, the presence of various implementation frictions and their spatial heterogeneity can significantly hamper their effectiveness. Consequently, we argue that effective mortgage market design will likely involve a combination of ex ante and ex post debt relief solutions, with state contingencies. We conclude by discussing the potential gains\textemdash which can be large, given significant regional heterogeneity\textemdash from tying mortgage terms and policies to local indicators, as well as mechanisms that may alleviate the adverse effects of ex post implementation frictions.},

  abstract = {A finalidade deste estudo \'e contribuir para uma avalia\c{c}\~ao da import\^ancia do obra de Kalecki na elucida\c{c}\~ao do funcionamento do economia capitalista. Sua proposi\c{c}\~ao central desloca, como principal contribui\c{c}\~ao desse autor, a formula\c{c}\~ao do princ\'ipio da demanda efetiva de um modo claro e prop\'icio \`a explicita\c{c}\~ao das mecanismos b\'asicos da din\^amica econ\^omica no capitalismo. Para tanto, rejeita-se a interpreta\c{c}\~ao convencional da demanda efetiva que enfatiza o papel do gasto aut\^onomo associado \`a interven\c{c}\~ao do Estado e aos per\'iodos recessivos, para coloc\'a-los numa perspectiva te\'orica, onde passa a assumir o car\'ater de princ\'ipio geral necess\'ario \`a refuta\c{c}\~ao da "Lei de Say" e \`a elabora\c{c}\~ao de uma teoria din\^amica. Sob este enfoque, o artigo analisa a exposi\c{c}\~ao da demanda efetiva feita por Kalecki, sublinhado o papel que nela tem a distribui\c{c}\~ao funcional da renda. Segue-se, uma interpreta\c{c}\~ao geral da teoria do ciclo econ\^omico desse autor, particularizada nos modelos de 1933 e 1954. Discute-se, ainda, a validade de uma an\'alise de ciclo ''puro", em oposi\c{c}\~ao \`a integra\c{c}\~ao entre ciclo e tend\^encia no mesmo quadro te\'orico. Sugerem-se, por fim, algumas das aplica\c{c}\~oes din\^amicas abertas pelo uso do esquema kaleckiano de tr\^es setores como instrumento anal\'itico.},

  abstract = {The paper offers an interpretation of the General Theory based on two main assumptions: (i) that its core is heterodox (meaning far from Neoclassical references) and (ii) that, while not working out a dynamic model, it is neither static nor based on the notion of equilibrium in the usual sense, i.e. as an attractor. It amounts rather to a foreword to a dynamic theory, given its emphasis on (future) time and expectations. The exposition is centered on the division between short and long run (period) with corresponding particularities and distinctions. In the first case, a more general concept of the principle of effective demand is proposed, from which the relation investment/savings, supply and demand functions at the Micro level \textendash{} where basic variables are determined -, the ``point of effective demand'' and corresponding aggregative versions are interpreted. In the second case, investment decisions are examined on the light of chap. 17, concerning investment in capital assets, i.e. individual demand for assets. The central concept of uncertainty is introduced here, giving place to money as an asset as well as to liquidity preference and the rate of interest theories. Long term expectations under uncertainty give rise to other two key concepts \textendash{} the state of confidence and the convention. As a result, his peculiar and crucial notion of instability of investment follows, as well as its extension to the capitalist economy as a whole.},

This paper presents an asset-market model of the housing market and estimates how changes in the expected inflation rate affect the real price of houses and the equilibrium size of the housing capital stock. Simulation results suggest that the accelerating inflation of the 1970s, which substantially reduced homeowners' user costs, could have accounted for as much as a 30 percent increase in real house prices. Persistent high inflation rates could lead ultimately to a sizable increase in the stock of owner-occupied housing.},

Using a time-varying dynamic factor model, we observe global co-movement across financial variables as well as variable-specific global cycles of different lengths and amplitudes. Global cycles have gained relevance over time. For equity prices, they now constitute the main driver of fluctuations in most countries. Global cycles in credit and housing have become much more pronounced and protracted since the 1980s, but their relevance increased for a sub-group of financially open and developed economies only. Panel regressions indicate that a country's susceptibility to global financial cycles tends to increase with financial openness and financial integration, the extent of mortgage-related lending, and the efficiency of stock markets. Understanding the cross-country heterogeneity in financial market characteristics therefore matters for the design of appropriate financial stabilization policies across countries and sectors.},

  abstract = {In this paper, I show that the income-autonomous demand multiplier of Keynesian-Kaleckian models is endogenous to changes in income distribution. This effect gives rise to non-linearity of distributional effects, even in basic models. Under certain conditions, an important consequence from the distribution-sensitive multiplier is that a higher wage share can have increasingly expansionary effects, which might even shift a profit-led investment regime to a wage-led one in the basic post-Kaleckian model. Surprisingly, the respective literature on distribution and growth largely ignored these features of Keynesian-Kaleckian macroeconomic models. After a theoretical discussion on the implications of the distribution-sensitive multiplier in basic closed- and openeconomy models, I present a counterfactual illustration based on empirical parameter estimations from the literature and the development of functional income distribution for selected EU countries. My analysis indicates that a rising profit share has put partial downward pressure on the wage-ledness of aggregate demand in many EU countries. These results stress the relevance of this particular form of path dependency for empirical research and policy debates on distribution and growth.},

The highest order is for the salaries of the first workers, second handyman, third foreman and the last is the chief handyman.

Greater income equality put more money into the hands of people with higher MPCs, leading to increased consumption; and greater inequality had the reverse impact. Yet, of the six objective factors that Keynes identified as affecting consumption, only distribution has failed to become part of mainstream consumption theory. This paper examines the reasons why this is so, and then develops a model incorporating the after-tax distribution into a Keynesian consumption function. Empirical tests of this model find that after-tax income distribution is a significant determinant of consumption.},

Policymakers in the major industrial countries and officials of international organizations are deeply concerned about rising public debt burdens.

Principles of Budgetary and Financial Policy seeks to bridge the gap between these views, showing how rigorous economic theory can be applied to the study of fiscal, financial, and monetary policy and examining the contributions of such policy to the goals of cyclical stabilization, structural adjustment, and secular growth in modern "mixed" economies. This book brings together twelve years of Willem Buiter's work on fiscal and financial policy, including both previously published and new essays. In addition to raising the level of policy debate, it unites the two subdisciplines into which economists have split the study of fiscal and financial policy: the microeconomic theory of neoclassical public finance and the macroeconomic neoKeynesian theory of stabilization policy. The book's introductory section sets the scene through broad ranging, nontechnical papers emphasizing the unavoidable interconnection of the stabilization role of fiscal policy with its allocational and distributional roles. In the following sections Buiter focuses on the measurement of public sector activity over time, considering how (and to what extent) a longer-run perspective on the government's finances can be summarized in a single comprehensive government balance sheet. He examines "crowding out," the displacement of private economic activity by public economic activity, explaining why and how public debt and deficits matter and emphasizing the distinction between various financing issues. The fiscal origins of inflation are addressed, as well as the eventual monetization of public sector deficits.

We build bridges between regression models and qualitative comparative analysis by comparing diagnostics and solutions to the problem of omitted variables and conditions. We then discuss various approaches and tackle the theoretical issues around causality which must be addressed before attending to technical fixes. In the conclusions, we reflect on the bridges built between the two traditions and draw more general lessons about the logic of social science research.},

  abstract = {Counterfactual analysis has a long and distinguished history in comparative research. To some, counterfactual analysis is central to comparative inquiry because such research typically embraces only a handful of empirical cases (Fearon 1991). If there are only a few instances (e.g., of revolution), then researchers, of necessity, must compare empirical cases to hypothetical cases. The affinity between counterfactual analysis and comparative research, however, derives not from its focus on small Ns, but from its configurational nature. Case-oriented explanations of outcomes are often combinatorial in nature, stressing specific configurations of causal conditions. Rather than focus on the net effects of causal conditions, case-oriented explanations emphasize their combined effects.},

Ragin has developed Qualitative Comparative Analysis and related set-analytic techniques as a means of bridging qualitative and quantitative methods of research. Now, with Peer C. Fiss, Ragin uses these impressive new tools to unravel the varied conditions affecting life chances. Ragin and Fiss begin by taking up the controversy regarding the relative importance of test scores versus socioeconomic background on life chances, a debate that has raged since the 1994 publication of Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray's TheBell Curve. In contrast to prior work, Ragin and Fiss bring an intersectional approach to the evidence, analyzing the different ways that advantages and disadvantages combine in their impact on life chances. Moving beyond controversy and fixed policy positions, the authors propose sophisticated new methods of analysis to underscore the importance of attending to configurations of race, gender, family background, educational achievement, and related conditions when addressing social inequality in America today.},

The main message of this article is that fuzzy sets, unlike conventional variables, must be calibrated. It also argues that fuzzy sets provide a middle path between quantitative and qualitative measurement. It explores the common measurement practices in quantitative and qualitative social research. It then further demonstrates that fuzzy sets resonate with both the measurement concerns of qualitative researchers, where the goal often is to recognize between relevant and irrelevant variation, and the measurement concerns of quantitative researchers, where the goal is the precise placement of cases relative to each other. Current practices in quantitative social science undercut serious attention to calibration. Set-theoretic analysis without careful calibration of set membership is an exercise in futility.},

  abstract = {Because of its inherently asymmetric nature, set-theoretic analysis offers many interesting contrasts with analysis based on correlations. Until recently, however, social scientists have been slow to embrace set-theoretic approaches. The perception was that this type of analysis is restricted to primitive, binary variables and that it has little or no tolerance for error. With the advent of ``fuzzy'' sets and the recognition that even rough set-theoretic relations are relevant to theory, these old barriers have crumbled. This paper advances the set-theoretic approach by presenting simple descriptive measures that can be used to evaluate set-theoretic relationships, especially relations between fuzzy sets. The first measure, ``consistency,'' assesses the degree to which a subset relation has been approximated, whereas the second measure, ``coverage,'' assesses the empirical relevance of a consistent subset. This paper demonstrates further that set-theoretic coverage can be partitioned in a manner somewhat analogous to the partitioning of explained variation in multiple regression analysis.},

  abstract = {The present work proposes a framework for the analysis of inequality in income composition. Hinging on the recent work by Ranaldi (2017), we here propose a metric of income-factor polarization, the Income-Factor Polarization Index If , that captures the extent to which two income sources, notably profits and wages, are polarized across the distribution of income. We measure income-factor polarization as the distance between the Polarization Curve for Income Source and the Zero-Polarization Curve, suitably normalized. The former is the cumulative distribution of income source across the population with individuals being indexed by their income rank, and the latter is the benchmark of zero inequality in income composition, defined as the situation in which each individual has the same population share of profits and wages (Ranaldi, 2017). The greater the distance, the higher the polarization. We show that the index narrows down to a single one the two conditions for the rising share of capital income to increase overall income Gini introduced by Milanovic (2017), which is: If {$>$} 0. The methodology is finally illustrated via an empirical application on the case of Italy.},

Piketty's historical description of this development from administrative data for individual countries is corroborated with new survey data for the eurozone, the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS). Wealth is extremely unequally distributed in the eurozone \textendash{} much more so than income. Furthermore, we provide a multi-faceted picture of wealth distribution in Europe using the socio-economic characteristics available in the HFCS, and we show that inheritances are the single most important factor for wealth inequality. The structural power to shape economic and political institutions is thus ever more concentrated. Finally, we discuss three channels through which the unequal distribution of private assets may affect power relations and economic activity.},

  abstract = {Even after one of the most severe multi-year crises on record in the advanced economies, the received wisdom in policy circles clings to the notion that high-income countries are completely different from their emerging market counterparts. The current phase of the official policy approach is predicated on the assumption that debt sustainability can be achieved through a mix of austerity, forbearance and growth. The claim is that advanced countries do not need to resort to the standard toolkit of emerging markets, including debt restructurings and conversions, higher inflation, capital controls and other forms of financial repression. As we document, this claim is at odds with the historical track record of most advanced economies, where debt restructuring or conversions, financial repression, and a tolerance for higher inflation, or a combination of these were an integral part of the resolution of significant past debt overhangs.},

Argumenta-se que a ades\~ao da Espanha \`a Uni\~ao Europeia redefiniu, no contexto europeu, sua posi\c{c}\~ao na divis\~ao internacional do trabalho, a partir da\'i, verifica-se, nas duas \'ultimas d\'ecadas, um conjunto de transforma\c{c}\~oes econ\^omicas e pol\'iticas que repercutiram diretamente em seu processo de urbaniza\c{c}\~ao recente, o que refor\c{c}ou o papel desempenhado pela produ\c{c}\~ao habitacional nas din\^amicas econ\^omicas do pa\'is e produziu um ciclo imobili\'ario sem precedentes. Contudo, este boom imobili\'ario n\~ao se materializou de maneira uniforme pelo territ\'orio espanhol, pelo contr\'ario, a an\'alise da economia regional e urbana do pa\'is indica uma forte concentra\c{c}\~ao espacial deste processo, sobretudo nas principais aglomera\c{c}\~oes urbanas, na costa mediterr\^anea e nos arquip\'elagos. A eclos\~ao da \'ultima crise financeira internacional p\^os fim ao boom imobili\'ario em curso e promoveu uma s\'erie de consequ\^encias na economia, na sociedade e no territ\'orio espanhol, al\'em de uma profunda reorganiza\c{c}\~ao dos mercados financeiro e imobili\'ario do pa\'is. Desde uma perspectiva territorial, o estudo do bairro Arcosur na prov\'incia de Zaragoza representa um dos casos mais emblem\'aticos de obras urbanas interrompidas pela crise, portanto, evidencia aspectos importantes de como as l\'ogicas financeiras e imobili\'arias influenciam o processo de produ\c{c}\~ao do espa\c{c}o urbano na escala local. Considerando os efeitos socioecon\^omicos da crise na Espanha, constatamos uma intensifica\c{c}\~ao dos conflitos sociais, sobretudo porque que as entidades financeiras que receberam dinheiro p\'ublico na gest\~ao da crise tamb\'em foram aquelas que mais tiveram execu\c{c}\~oes hipotecarias em seu favor, configurando, assim, o que Harvey (2003) denomina de acumula\c{c}\~ao por despossess\~ao. Neste contexto, houve uma reorganiza\c{c}\~ao da estrutura e do funcionamento tanto do financeiro como do imobili\'ario no pa\'is, por\'em, o aumento da concentra\c{c}\~ao e centraliza\c{c}\~ao de capital destes setores constituiu um ambiente de neg\'ocios prop\'icio \`a atua\c{c}\~ao de fundos de investimento imobili\'ario nas principais cidades espanholas. Neste sentido, a an\'alise da venda de 1.860 moradias p\'ublicas em Madri ao Grupo Fidere e a Blackstone nos revela tra\c{c}os marcantes das pr\'aticas predat\'orias resultantes das novas articula\c{c}\~oes entre o poder p\'ublico local, o financeiro e imobili\'ario. Esta conjuntura, por sua vez, exigiu por parte da popula\c{c}\~ao uma importante mobiliza\c{c}\~ao social em torno principalmente, da quest\~ao habitacional. Assim, movimentos sociais como a Plataforma dos Afetados pela Hipoteca (PAH) desempenharam um papel extremamente importante no pa\'is alterando a correla\c{c}\~ao de for\c{c}as estabelecida e legitimando a luta pelo direito \`a habita\c{c}\~ao. Em s\'intese, a an\'alise do caso espanhol nos revela como exacerba\c{c}\~ao das finan\c{c}as passa a comandar as mais diversas dimens\~oes da economia e da sociedade, o que faz com que o processo de produ\c{c}\~ao do espa\c{c}o e o acesso a habita\c{c}\~ao estejam submetidos, cada vez mais, aos imperativos do mercado. Deste modo, conclui-se que a implementa\c{c}\~ao de pol\'iticas neoliberais e, consequentemente, o paulatino recuo do Estado de bem-estar social vai na contram\~ao da constru\c{c}\~ao de uma sociedade mais justa e equitativa},

Asset markets in countries with more credit inflows are more sensitive to the global cycle. The global financial cycle is not aligned with countries' specific macroeconomic conditions. Symptoms can go from benign to large asset price bubbles and excess credit creation, which are among the best predictors of financial crises. A VAR analysis suggests that one of the determinants of the global financial cycle is monetary policy in the centre country, which affects leverage of global banks, capital flows and credit growth in the international financial system. Whenever capital is freely mobile, the global financial cycle constrains national monetary policies regardless of the exchange rate regime.},

US society has been built upon the dream of homeownership which peaked at 68 per cent of households in 2007, but has fallen since. From 2006 house prices began to tumble, the construction industry declined, as did general consumption expenditures while unemployment rose into the double digits. Foreclosures have become rampant with almost 832,000 sales in 2010. These trends and policies are the backdrop to this chapter. It has two main sections. The first examines in detail how the geography of the ups (approximately 1995\textendash 2007) and the downs (from 2007 to the present) in house prices varied in cities across the country, and the reasons for these differences. The second section looks at the potential menu of reforms in housing policies and practices that may prevent a recurrence.},

We find out that the number of QCA applications has dramatically increased during the past few years. The mapping also reveals that csQCA remains the most frequently used technique, that political science, sociology, and management are the core disciplines of application, that macrolevel analyses, medium-N designs, and a mono-method use of QCA remain predominant. A particular focus is also laid on the ratio between the number of cases and number of conditions and the compliance to benchmarks in this respect.},

  abstract = {During the past two decades, a set of systematic comparative case analysis techniques                 has been developing at a steady pace. During the last few years especially, the main                 initial technique, qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), has been complemented by                 other related methods and techniques. The purpose of this article is to critically                 assess some main recent developments in this field. QCA and connected methods can be                 considered at two levels: as a research strategy and as a set of concrete                 techniques. The author first argues that such a strategy displays some decisive                 advantages in social science research, especially in small-and                 intermediate-N research designs. Second, QCA as well as three other related                 techniques, namely multi-value QCA (MVQCA), fuzzy sets and MSDO/MDSO, are presented                 in brief, and some current debates with regard to these techniques are also                 summarized. In the third section, the article surveys recent contributions and                 ongoing efforts that have provided some advances in the application of these                 techniques, around five key issues: case selection and model specification;                 measurement, dichotomization and linkage with theory; contradictions and                 non-observed cases; the time and process dimension; and the confrontation or                 combination with other methods. Finally, the article discuss the potential for                 further development of these methods in social science research broadly defined.},

QCA is first presented both as an approach and as a set of techniques (crisp-set, multi-value and fuzzy-set QCA), both of which feature specific characteristics. In a second section, it is argued that there is a preferential connection between QCA and public policy analysis: in terms of research design and also in terms of the actual goals and needs of policy-oriented research. Further, the bulk of the article contains an exhaustive survey of empirical applications published so far. To do so, a typology of applications is developed along two dimensions: the stages in the policy process (from agenda-setting and policy initiation to policy evaluation) and the level at which the 'cases' or units of analysis are empirically defined (from micro to macro). A total of 143 applications are surveyed, gathered in 16 clusters according to the two dimensions in the typology. For all these applications, the focus is laid on the concrete ways in which QCA has been exploited, with short indications on the research questions and research results. In con-clusion, the achievements reached so far, as well as some remaining limita-tions, are discussed. Some of the most promising avenues for further re-search are also sketched, in terms of 'mixed' methods designs, causal mech-anisms, 'casing strategies', and unexploited 'niches' both in terms of levels of analysis and stages of policy processes.},

Over this period, capital gains averaged 8\% of national income and comprised a third of total capital income. Capital gains are not included in the national income and product accounts, where the definition of national income reflects the goal of measuring current production. To explain the accumulation of household wealth and distribution of capital income, both of which are affected by changes in asset prices, this paper uses the Haig-Simons income concept, which includes capital gains. Accounting for capital gains increases the measured capital share of income by 5 p.p., increases the comprehensive savings rate (inclusive of capital gains) by 6 p.p., and leads to a greater measured increase in income inequality.},

Overall, the net capital share has increased since 1948, but once disaggregated this increase turns out to come entirely from the housing sector: the contribution to net capital income from all other sectors has been zero or slightly negative, as the fall and rise have offset each other. Several influential accounts of the recent rise emphasize the role of increased capital accumulation, but this view is at odds with theory and evidence: it requires empirically improbable elasticities of substitution, and it presumes a correlation between the capital-income ratio and capital share that is not visible in the data. A more limited narrative that stresses scarcity and the increased cost of housing better fits the data. These results are clarified using a new, multisector model of factor shares.},

This paper argues, however, that even before the Covid-19 shock, a decades-long housing boom had given rise to severe price misalignments and regional supply-demand mismatches, making an adjustment both necessary and inevitable. We make use of newly available and updated data sources to analyze supply-demand conditions in the fast-moving Chinese economy. The imbalances are then compared to benchmarks from other economies. We conclude that the sector is quite vulnerable to a sustained aggregate growth shock, such as Covid-19 might pose. In our baseline calibration, using input-output tables and taking account of the very large footprint of housing construction and real-estate related sectors, the adjustment to a decline in housing activity can easily trim a cumulative 5-10 percent from the level of output (over a period of years).},

In a recent contribution to this journal, multilevel Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) was proposed as a new methodological tool for discerning set-relational patterns in multilevel data. I argue that the presentation of multilevel QCA is erroneous in two respects. First, multilevel QCA ignores the fact that equifinal solutions entail diversity and therefore leads one to overestimate the complexity of QCA solutions. Second, the ordinary minimization procedure of truth tables that contain multilevel data yields the same solutions as multilevel QCA, but is much easier to implement. I conclude that the established inventory of QCA does not need to be extended by a special multilevel approach.},

In a Kaleckian perspective, the economic regime can be either wage-or profit-led and it can change through time. The contribution of this paper is to explore the possibility of a regime switch in the Brazilian economy from 2003 to 2014 by discussing the mechanisms that may have led to such shift and by testing this possibility through a structural vector autoregressive model (SVAR) with an estimated structural break. The results suggest a demand regime switch from wage-to profit-led and an accumulation regime switch from neutral to profit-led after the first quarter of 2010. Thus, the higher wage share had a positive impact on the Brazilian economy, but such effect weakened when the underlying economic conditions changed.},

Therefore, the housing price cycle can affect firms' R\&D investment through influencing their real estate value. By examining listed R\&D firms during the housing boom period 2002\textendash 2006 in the U.S., we find that a \$1 increase in real estate value leads a firm to increase its R\&D investment by \$0.38. We also find that this collateral effect is more pronounced among financially constrained R\&D firms than that among unconstrained ones. Additionally, we examine the housing bust period 2008\textendash 2012, and find that real estate depreciation retarded R\&D investment, especially among constrained R\&D firms.},

  abstract = {The difference and system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators are growing in popularity. As implemented in popular software, the estimators easily generate instruments that are numerous and, in system GMM, potentially suspect. A large instrument collection overfits endogenous variables even as it weakens the Hansen test of the instruments' joint validity. This paper reviews the evidence on the effects of instrument proliferation, and describes and simulates simple ways to control it. It illustrates the dangers by replicating Forbes [American Economic Review (2000) Vol. 90, pp. 869\textendash 887] on income inequality and Levine et al. [Journal of Monetary Economics] (2000) Vol. 46, pp. 31\textendash 77] on financial sector development. Results in both papers appear driven by previously undetected endogeneity.},

Hearne contextualises the Irish housing crisis within the broader global housing situation by examining the origins of the crisis in terms of austerity, marketisation and the new era of financialisation, where global investors are making housing unaffordable and turning it into an asset for the wealthy. He brings to the fore the perspectives of those most affected, new housing activists and protesters whilst providing innovative global solutions for a new vision for affordable, sustainable homes for all.},

  abstract = {The analysis of Portuguese inflation, based on annual data from 1961 to 2012, using the Johansen Method, allows us to conclude that variation in Portuguese inflation is determined essentially by foreign inflation and by variation in the effective exchange rate, but the lagged variation of budget deficit seems to causes variation of inflation in the studied period. In the long run there are two long-run relationships. Both the inflation rate and the wage inflation rate relate positively with the General Government Balance in percentage of GDP, negatively with the exchange rate index, positively with the foreign inflation index and negatively with the trend. In the short run the variation of the inflation rate relates positively with foreign inflation (or its variation) and the variation in the effective exchange rate, relates negatively with the error correction mechanism, so there is a significant response to the equilibrium error between inflation rate and its determinants. In addition to this adjustment, the inflation rate responds positively and significantly to the lagged variation of the budget deficit, as expected.},

  abstract = {Applying qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to large Ns relaxes researchers' case-based knowledge. This is problematic because causality in QCA is inferred from a dialogue between empirical, theoretical, and casebased knowledge. The lack of case-based knowledge may be remedied by various robustness tests. However, being a case-based method, QCA is designed to be sensitive to such tests, meaning that also large-N QCA robustness tests must be evaluated against substantive knowledge. This article connects QCA's substantive-interpretation approach of causality to critical realism. From that perspective, it identifies relevant robustness tests and applies them to a real-data large-N QCA study. Robustness test findings are visualized in a robustness table, and this article develops criteria to substantively interpret them. The robustness table is introduced as a tool to substantiate the validity of causal claims in large-N QCA studies.},

Instead of providing unsatisfactory monocausal explanations, the approach identifies different combinations of conditions leading to a given outcome. The authors illustrate their points with a two-step multi-value QCA (mvQCA) of 17 transport policy cases in Switzerland.},

Antweiler and Frank (2004) showed that public forums are significant when predicting stock market outcomes, lending validity to our text source. Our methodology includes identifying a relevant dictionary of positive and negative words, scraping BiggerPockets real estate forums, running a textual sentiment analysis, and finally regressing against fundamental housing market indicators in 34 large metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) to assess sentiment's predictability on home prices.},

  author = {Sant'Anna, Andr{\'e} Albuquerque},
  pages = {20},
  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to discuss the role of the existence of a powerful socialist bloc as a disciplining device to inequality in western countries. The recent literature on top income inequality has emphasized explanations that go beyond the marginal productivity framework to explain top incomes. Usually the literature points to domestic factors such as top income tax rates and bargaining power. Some authors also assign a role for external factors such as the two World Wars that played in destroying capital, whether physical or financial, through inflation. Nevertheless, this literature does not embody the contributions of the state capacity literature that recognizes external conflicts as a source for the development of institutions that increase state capacity. In this paper, we analyze the role of a latent conflict that has occurred from WWII to the eighties: the Cold War. We believe this lasting conflict helped to shape the creation of common-interest states, as Besley and Persson (2013) defined. Under these commoninterest states, a social cohesion emerged because of the presence of a powerful external enemy, leading to reduced top income shares. In order to test our hypothesis, we run a panel of 18 OECD countries between 1960-2010. We find a robust and negative significant relation between Soviet Union's relative military power and top income shares.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in housing and financial markets have led to fresh interest in the empirical evidence on wealth effects on consumption. This paper aims at providing up-to-date estimates of wealth effects by using a vector error correction model (VECM) approach to account for endogeneity and allow for the possibility of more than one variable equilibrating the system, in the same vein as previous work by Lettau and Ludvigson in the US. The breakdown of wealth into its housing and financial components leads to additional possibilities of adjustment to reach the long run equilibrium. In addition, the model accounts for potentially different values of the parameters linking consumption and wealth when distinguishing between durable and nondurable goods.},

  abstract = {Immediately following the global financial crisis of 2007\textendash 2008, budget deficits rose from the operation of the automatic stabilisers and some mild discretionary actions to bolster demand in the face of the economic downturn. This was soon replaced by drives to reduce budget deficits and debt ratios even though unemployment continued to be high and output well below previous levels. The `debt scare' behind fiscal consolidation is examined and found wanting on empirical and theoretical grounds. The nature and estimates of `the multiplier' are examined and the consequences of the wide range of estimates considered. There has been a shift to the formulation of fiscal policy in terms of a balanced structural budget. This shift relies on discredited ideas, such as a well-defined and stable non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, and brings back the notion that savings and investment necessarily balance at a full employment equilibrium.},

Our findings are based on a multi-methods approach and highlight the varying importance of hegemonic influences in post-1945 Latin America. We argue that US support for democratization was consistent in the wave of transitions to democracy that began in Latin America in 1978 and that it was decisive in many of these transitions. While past work has attributed responsibility to the US for the waves of democratic breakdowns from 1948 to 1956 and 1964 to 1976, an examination of the 27 breakdowns from 1945 to 2010 gives reason to doubt this interpretation. Future research could use these conceptual and methodological tools to explore the role of other powers in waves of democracy and authoritarianism.},

Moreover, the models presented in this paper point to values of the (approximated) private income elasticity around 0.4 and credit and interest (semi) elasticities of household consumption around 2\% and -2\%, respectively.},

There are, however, only few guidelines on how to combine them with qualitative case studies. Contributing to the literature on multi-method research (MMR), we offer the first comprehensive elaboration of principles for the integration of QCA and case studies with a special focus on case selection. We show that QCA's reliance on set-relational causation in terms of necessity and sufficiency has important consequences for the choice of cases. Using real world data for both crisp-set and fuzzy-set QCA, we show what typical and deviant cases are in QCA-based MMR. In addition, we demonstrate how to select cases for comparative case studies aiming to discern causal mechanisms and address the puzzles behind deviant cases. Finally, we detail the implications of modifying the set-theoretic cross-case model in the light of case-study evidence. Following the principles developed in this article should increase the inferential leverage of set-theoretic MMR.},

One source of such assumptions can be statements of necessity. QCA realists, the majority of QCA researchers, have elaborated a set of criteria for meaningful claims of necessity: empirical consistency, empirical relevance, and conceptual meaningfulness. I show that once Thiem's (2017) data mining approach to detecting supersets is constrained by adhering to those standards, no CONSOL effect of Schneider and Wagemann's ESA exists. QCA idealists, challenging most of QCA realists' conventions, argue that separate searches for necessary conditions are futile because the most parsimonious solution formula reveals the minimally necessary disjunction of minimally sufficient conjunctions. Engaging with this perspective, I address several unresolved empirical and theoretical issues that seem to prevent the QCA idealist position from becoming mainstream.},

However, real-world research situations might make the application of fs/QCA difficult in two respects \textendash{} namely, the complexity of the results and the phenomenon of limited diversity. We suggest a two-step approach as one possibility to mitigate these problems. After introducing the difference between remote and proximate factors, the application of a two-step fs/QCA approach is demonstrated analyzing the causes of the consolidation of democracy. We find that different paths lead to consolidation, but all are characterized by a fit of the institutional mix chosen to the societal context in terms of power dispersion. Hence, we demonstrate that the application of fs/QCA in a two-step manner helps to formulate and test equifinal and conjunctural hypotheses in medium-size N comparative analyses, and thus to contribute to an enhanced understanding of social phenomena.},

The rate of capacity utilization, i.e. the output-capacity ratio, is found to be stationary since production capacities respond endogenously to changes in current output and not vice versa. Hence, the principle of effective demand in a growth context, by which a permanent demand shock has a permanent growth effect, is consistent with the stylized fact of a stationary rate of capacity utilization since production capacities are endogenous in the long run.},

A positive and significant adjustment parameter has been found relating the growth rate of capital productivity to the difference between the realized utilization rate and the target rate. The endogenous capital productivity is then introduced to a simple Kaleckian growth model with constant rate of utilization in the long run. The effects of shocks to investment, consumption and distribution are studied. We show that the paradox of thrift and the paradox of cost may only hold if Harrodian instability is introduced accompanied by stabilizing counter-forces such as debt dynamics.},

A gradual shift in CPE's research agenda from macroeconomic to microeconomic concerns, and from demand-side to supply-side explanations, diminished its ability to analyze adequately the central economic and political problems of the past twenty years. This article traces CPE's evolution through successive ``supermodels'' that constituted its core research foci. To understand the current crisis, CPE needs to revisit and update its original roots in Keynes, macroeconomics, and the demand side. This shift is already happening at the margins, as CPE scholars struggle to understand the current crisis.},

Yet both CPE and IPE ignore the single largest asset in people's everyday lives and one of the biggest financial assets in most economies: residential property and its associated mortgage debt. This volume argues that residential housing and housing finance systems have important causal consequences for political behavior, social stability, the structure of welfare states, and macroeconomic outcomes. Put bluntly, home equity and social equity are often at odds. The individual country chapters and paired country comparisons show specific instances of these outcomes, while Chapter 9 considers the origins and responses to the 2007\textendash 08 crises. This introductory chapter has broader aims.},

It develops a general equilibrium, overlapping generations model with financial and housing assets, where mortgage debt is collateralized. The model generates an endogenous increase in housing prices through an unexpected decrease in the interest rate and down-payment requirement. There is a redistribution of welfare from renters towards young homeowners. Middle-aged home-owners lose from lower capital gains on their financial assets more than they benefit from the reevaluation of their housing assets.},

Researchers have examined various elements and conditions of the communication that may be related to the impact of intergroup contact. However, due to methodological limitations, the extent to which these conditions are necessary or sufficient to produce positive intergroup outcomes has been unclear. We used fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fs/QCA) to analyze how several communicative and psychological variables might be necessary and/or sufficient to produce positive intergroup attitudes toward ``illegal'' immigrants within an imagined intergroup contact experience. Findings suggest that certain combinations of conditions for contact are sufficient for producing positive attitudes toward social group members but that there are no necessary causes. The discussion emphasizes the implications for intergroup contact and the utility of fs/QCA.},

  abstract = {Canada's record both before and during the financial crisis has been recognized by many in the media as one of great achievement that other countries should seek to learn from and emulate: a dozen years of public-sector budgetary surpluses followed by fiscal stimulus packages that spanned two years after the financial crisis, and the lowest budget deficits and debt-to-gross domestic product ratios of the G-7 countries. This paper looks carefully at that record and asks the question of whether the policy of austerity pursued before the financial crisis and after 2010 is one that should seriously be emulated. After analyzing the destabilizing consequences of this policy for sustaining future growth, the article concludes that the restrictive fiscal actions taken before the financial crisis did little to protect the Canadian economy from the crisis and recession that followed, and was essentially a Pyrrhic victory.},

Hence, a weakening of the inequality measures to a mixture of partly descriptive and partly normative considerations is proposed. A number of reasons for taking inequality rankings as quasi-orderings rather than complete orderings are suggested.},

A caracter\'istica marcante deste tipo de gasto \'e que ele n\~ao cria capacidade produtiva e , ao mesmo tempo, n\~ao \'e financiado pela folha de sal\'arios da economia. O termo 'gasto improdutivo' ser\'a usado neste trabalho para designar todas as despesas que ajudam a realizar (vender) o produto da economia mas n\~ao criam capacidade produtiva, menos a parte da folha salarial que retorna " automaticamente " ao conjunto das empresas e que representa o consumo induzido dos trabalhadores. 1 Como estamos interessados no papel macroecon\^omico do gasto improdutivo, vamos interpretar esta categoria de gastos num sentido amplo, independente de sua forma espec\'ifica ou do agente ou institui\c{c}\~ao que o efetue. 2 * O autor agradece o apoio financeiro do CNPq e a Fabio Freitas e Carlos Medeiros por in\'umeras discuss\~oes sobre o tema. ** do IE-UFRJ 1 Como os economistas cl\'assicos usualmente supunham que os trabalhadores n\~ao poupavam estes gastos eram com frequ\^encia referidos como gasto improdutivo do excedente. No entanto, quando levamos em conta a possibilidade de poupan\c{c}a dos trabalhadores e que estes tamb\'em podem financiar seu consumo atrav\'es do cr\'edito ou alguma riqueza acumulada fica melhor utilizar o termo mais geral 'gasto improdutivo'. 2 Isso significa que ser\~ao considerados gasto improdutivo para os prop\'ositos deste artigo todos os gastos p\'ublicos (inclusive em investimento pois n\~ao criam diretamente capacidade produtiva para o setor privado), todas as exporta\c{c}\~oes (inclusive de bens de capital, pois n\~ao criam capacidade para a economia que os exporta), o consumo financiado por cr\'edito ou pela riqueza, tanto de propriet\'arios quanto de trabalhadores e tamb\'em alguns gastos que com frequ\^encia s\~ao considerados investimento privado mas n\~ao criam capacidade produtiva como despesas empresariais em geral e em pesquisa \& desenvolvimento e em particular boa parte da constru\c{c}\~ao civil que configura em investimento residencial (compra de im\'oveis para resid\^encia). Esta classifica\c{c}\~ao corresponde ao que Garegnani(1962) chamou de 'demanda final' menos o consumo induzido da folha salarial.},

Em primeiro lugar, apresentar da forma mais simples e b\'asica poss\'ivel os aspectos principais das diversas teorias do crescimento, tanto neocl\'assicas quanto heterodoxas. Em segundo lugar, novamente considerando apenas seus aspectos mais essenciais, fazer uma avalia\c{c}\~ao cr\'itica preliminar das diversas teorias, no que diz respeito tanto a consist\^encia l\'ogico-te\'orica quanto \`a poss\'ivel relev\^ancia para o entendimento de alguns fatos estilizados b\'asicos sobre o processo de desenvolvimento. II. As teorias neocl\'assicas do crescimento II.1 O mecanismo de mercado na abordagem neocl\'assica As teorias do crescimento da abordagem neocl\'assica (ou marginalista) s\~ao baseadas na vis\~ao da opera\c{c}\~ao normal do mecanismo de mercado erigida a partir do chamado princ\'ipio da substitui\c{c}\~ao. De acordo com esta vis\~ao, os chamados fatores de produ\c{c}\~ao seriam basicamente substitutos, tanto atrav\'es da substitui\c{c}\~ao direta na produ\c{c}\~ao, em fun\c{c}\~ao inversa de seus pre\c{c}os relativos, quanto por meio da substitui\c{c}\~ao indireta de fatores (que ocorre quando os consumidores substituem os produtos relativamente mais caros, por serem mais intensivos em fatores de produ\c{c}\~ao de pre\c{c}o relativamente mais alto, pelos mais baratos). A suposta exist\^encia em desta geral rela\c{c}\~ao inversa entre a quantidade utilizada de cada " fator de produ\c{c}\~ao " e seu pre\c{c}o relativos permitiria, sob condi\c{c}\~oes competitivas, tanto uma tend\^encia de longo prazo \`a plena utiliza\c{c}\~ao das dota\c{c}\~oes de todos os fatores de produ\c{c}\~ao quanto simultaneamente a caracteriza\c{c}\~ao de seus pre\c{c}os relativos como um \'indice de sua escassez relativa. Nesta abordagem, em condi\c{c}\~oes competitivas (isto \'e, com flexibilidade nominal e real de seus pre\c{c}os) todos os fatores de produ\c{c}\~ao que tenham um pre\c{c}o positivo s\~ao necessariamente escassos e tendem a ser plenamente empregados a longo prazo.},

Abstract In the paper we evaluate the growth and income distribution in the Brazilian Economy in the 2000s, showing that the improvement of the macroeconomic indicators results from the interaction between major changes in external conditions with which the Brazilian economy was facing (since 2003) and small changes in orientation domestic economic policy (since 2005). We also access the limits, in terms of external competitiveness and the balance of payments sustainability, of this type of growth regime maintaining the current inflation target system. Finally, we propose some alternative policy, showing that more than mere different views on the functioning of the economy, they also concern the different results in terms of functional income distribution.},

  abstract = {The paper shows that the Sraffian Supermultiplier model provides an alternative closure for the analysis of the relationships between economic growth, income distribution, capacity utilization and effective demand in heterodox growth models. The new closure comes from the variability of the ratio of the average to the marginal propensity to save (herein called fraction), which is entailed by the assumption of the existence of (an independently growing) autonomous expenditures that do not generate capacity for the private sector. This variability allows the marginal propensity to invest to determine the saving ratio without the need of changes in income distribution. If it is also assumed that changes in the marginal propensity to invest are induced by the competitive need to gradually adjust capacity to demand, this adjustment by means of endogenous changes in the fraction provides a closure that allows us to reconcile demand led growth, exogenous distribution and a tendency towards normal capacity utilization, even across steady states. A comparative analysis points out the distinctive features of this new clousure by contrasting its main results to the ones obtained with the closures associated to both the Cambridge and the Kaleckian growth models.},

  abstract = {The paper shows that the Sraffian Supermultiplier model provides an alternative closure for the analysis of the relationships between economic growth, income distribution, capacity utilization and effective demand in heterodox growth models. The new closure comes from the variability of the ratio of the average to the marginal propensity to save (herein called fraction), which is entailed by the assumption of the existence of (an independently growing) autonomous expenditures that do not generate capacity for the private sector. This variability allows the marginal propensity to invest to determine the saving ratio without the need of changes in income distribution. If it is also assumed that changes in the marginal propensity to invest are induced by the competitive need to gradually adjust capacity to demand, this adjustment by means of endogenous changes in the fraction provides a closure that allows us to reconcile demand led growth, exogenous distribution and a tendency towards normal capacity utilization, even across steady states. A comparative analysis points out the distinctive features of this new clousure by contrasting its main results to the ones obtained with the closures associated to both the Cambridge and the Kaleckian growth models.},

  abstract = {The paper argues that Harrodian instability is an instance of what Hicks in his book Capital and Growth (1965) called static instability, related to the direction (and not to the intensity) of the disequilibrium adjustment process. We show why such instability obtains in demand-led growth models in which the ratio of capacity creating private investment to output ratio is given exogenously by the aggregate marginal propensity to save. We also show that Sraffian Supermultiplier model overcomes the Harrodian instability and that its demand-led equilibrium is statically stable. It is explained that the latter results do not follow from the presence of autonomous non-capacity creating expenditure component as such but from its presence within a model in which investment is driven by the capital stock adjustment principle (i.e., the flexible accelerator). Finally, we argue that, although being statically stable, the equilibrium growth path of the Sraffian Supermultiplier model can be dynamically stable or unstable depending on the intensity of the reaction of investment to demand. We then provide a discrete time sufficient condition for the dynamic stability of such equilibrium that implies that the marginal propensity to invest remains lower than the marginal propensity to save during the adjustment process, a modified Keynesian stability condition.},

In our model, workers first make consumption decisions based on their gross income, and then treat debt servicing commitments as a substitute for saving. Workers' borrowing is induced by their desire to keep up with the consumption standard set by rentiers' consumption, reflecting an aspect of the relative income hypothesis. As a result of this consumption and debt servicing behavior, consumer debt accumulation and income distribution have effects on aggregate demand, profitability, and economic growth that differ from those found in existing models. We also investigate the financial sustainability of the Golden Age and Neoliberal growth regimes within our framework. It is shown that distributional changes between the Golden Age and the Neoliberal regimes, together with corresponding changes in consumption emulation behavior via expenditure cascades, suffice to make the Neoliberal growth regime unsustainable.},

  abstract = {Kaleckians describe a normal rate of capacity utilization that is subject to hysteresis effects. This means that the normal rate varies directly with the actual rate of capacity utilization, ensuring that steady-state equilibrium conditions in the Kaleckian model are fully adjusted (the actual and normal rates of capacity utilization are equalized) but without this last condition implying that the rate of capacity utilization is constant in the long run. The relationship between distribution and growth unique to the Kaleckian model is thus preserved. The hysteresis mechanism has been criticized from various quarters, however, these criticisms focusing on its alleged lack of behavioural foundations. This paper shows that consistent with the stylized facts, variation in the normal rate of capacity utilization in response to variation in the actual capacity utilization rate can be derived from the links between both variables and the volatility of the macroeconomic environment \textendash{} volatility, in the presence of fundamental uncertainty, being an important reason why firms deliberately under-utilize capacity (even in the long run) in the first place. The result is an empirically-grounded behavioural foundation for hysteresis in the normal rate of capacity utilization.},

The closures are shown to have different implications for the behaviour of the rate of capacity utilization and hence whether and how the economy achieves a ``fully-adjusted position'' (equalization of the actual and normal rates of capacity utilization). Assuming that the normal rate of capacity utilization is exogenously fixed, it is then shown that variation in the actual capacity utilization rate can nevertheless occur \textendash{} at least within limits \textendash{} without triggering ``Harrodian instability''. This result emanates from a discontinuity in the investment function that is grounded in Harrod's own macrodynamics, so that it is ultimately the combination of Harrodian and Kaleckian dynamics that gives rise to long-run variations in the actual rate of capacity utilization in the presence of a fixed normal rate. Aggregate and industry-level US capacity utilization data are then used to calculate possible bands within which the rate of capacity utilization may vary without triggering Harrodian instability. A key finding is that the conditions necessary for the latter appear to be relatively rare.},

The debt dynamics of the US economy are then studied under alternative assumptions about the configuration of distributional variables, which is shown to differ across varieties of capitalism that have `neoliberalised' to different degrees. A key result is that distributional change alone will not make contemporary US capitalism financially sustainable due, in part, to the paradoxical nature of inequality as a spur to household borrowing, and hence a source of both demand-formation and financial fragility.

This study aims to explain this cross-national diversity through a qualitative comparative analysis of labour market policy responses to the Great Recession across eighteen advanced welfare states. The results of the study suggest that theories of welfare state change that attribute theoretical centrality to political and institutional factors do not provide a compelling explanation for patterns of labour market reform observed since the onset of the economic crisis. Rather, they appear to be explained principally in terms of the variable fiscal capacity of the state. In particular, the study findings indicate that the presence of fiscal crisis has acted as a necessary (but insufficient) condition for the presence of recommodification, while the absence of fiscal crisis has acted as a sufficient (but unnecessary) condition for the absence of recommodification. These empirical developments suggest that there is a need for a scholarly return to the problematic relationship between capitalism and the welfare state.},

  abstract = {This paper utilizes the econophysics "two class" (EPTC) approach to income distribution to derive certain empirical rules applying to all countries in the comprehensive World Income Inequality (WIID) database. This approach demonstrates that wage incomes follow an exponential distribution while property incomes follow a Pareto distribution, which leads to a simple and empirically robust approximation to the Lorenz curve. We in turn show that the per capita income of any bottom fraction (x) of the population is proportional to ``inequality adjusted GDP per capita'', i.e. to (GDP per capita).(1-Gini), the constant of proportionality a(x) being solely a function of population fraction under consideration. This proposition is empirically robust across countries and over time in our large database. We focus on two patterns. The ``1.1 Rule'' in which the income per capita of the bottom 80 percent of a country's population, what we call the Vast Majority Income, can be calculated in every country as 1.1(GDP per capita).(1-Gini). Using the VMI in place of GDP per capita gives rise to different country rankings. Secondly, the ``1.0 Rule'' in which the per capita income of the bottom 70 percent is directly equal to inequality adjusted GDP per capita. Sen (1976) uses traditional welfare theory to arrive at inequality adjusted GDP per capita as a measure of social welfare while we use EPTC to arrive at it as a measure of the per capita income of the bottom 70 percent.},

Firms cite ample cash holdings as the most frequent reason to explain their lack of sensitivity. This result is consistent with dynamic models of corporate behavior in which firms build cash buffers in anticipation of potential changes in external financing conditions. In the cross section, we find that the investment plans tend to be the least sensitive to interest rate changes at firms that do not expect to borrow over the coming year and firms facing less-binding financing constraints.},

After the credit crisis, securitisation was blamed for allowing the 'hot potato' of bad loans to be passed to unsuspecting investors. Both views miss the endogeneity of credit supply. Securitisation enables credit expansion through higher leverage of the financial system as a whole. Securitisation by itself may not enhance financial stability if the imperative to expand assets drives down lending standards. The 'hot potato' of bad loans sits in the financial system on the balance sheets of large banks rather than being sold on to final investors, since the aim of financial intermediaries is to expand lending in order to utilise slack in balance sheet capacity.

  abstract = {This paper argues that the amended versions (financial wedge and secular stagnation) of the simple pragmatic New Consensus model are as open to theretical criticism as the original one. We show that: (1) the real natural rate of interest is unlikely to be negative and (2) it (inconsistently) depends on the neoclassical investment function drawn at a position of full employment, in a model which the economy is demand constrained; (3) both investment and full employment saving are induced by the trend of demand in the longer run and this challenges the usefulness of the notion of a natural or neutral rate of interest, which (4) are also subject to the sraffian capital critique. This is then constrasted to an alternative simple Sraffian Supermultiplier model in which the interest rate and the financial wedge are distributive instead of allocative variables, and there is no natural rate of interest since in the longer run there is no trade-off between consumption and investment and also no full employment of labor. As the capital stock adjusts to demand, potential (capacity) saving will be be determined by investment, and both investment and capacity saving increase when consumption increases. Finally, we briefly illustrate how this alternative model could begin to make sense of the recent relevant stylized facts.},

Their infancy, however, means that the limits and advantages of these techniques are not clear. Tests on the sensitivity of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) results have been sparse in previous empirical studies, and so has the provision of guidelines for doing this. Therefore this article uses data from a textbook example to discuss and illustrate various robustness checks of results based on the employment of crisp-set QCA and fuzzy-set QCA. In doing so, it focuses on three issues: the calibration of raw data into set-membership values, the frequency of cases linked to the configurations, and the choice of consistency thresholds. The study emphasizes that robustness tests, using systematic procedures, should be regarded as an important, and maybe even indispensable, analytical step in configurational comparative analysis.},

We searched financial big data for the UK, USA, Japan and China for a period 2004Q1 to 2019Q1 to find important data corresponding to the research and determine their importance for the financial cycle studies. We use singular spectral analysis (SSA without financial big data) and multichannel singular spectral analysis (MSSA with financial big data) to identify significant deterministic cycles in the residential property prices, credits to private non-financial sector and credit share in the GDP. The forecast test results show on the data for the UK, USA, Japan and China that inclusion of the financial big data significantly (on the level from 30\% to four times) improves forecast accuracy for financial cycle components.

This paper clarifies a mechanism through which an inefficient financial system can reduce productivity growth.

Moreover, the current global financial crisis can be accounted among the crisis largely connected with the asset markets. There are a large number of empirical researches that explain the connection between the cycles in asset price and credit and financial stability. In this paper we present a new methodology for determining the cycles in asset prices. By this methodology we have defined the cycles in asset prices in the United States and analyzed the specifics of the proposed method of determining the cycle compared to previously used methods. Analysing the events in previous cycles in asset prices, we find the rationale for the proposed method of determining the cycle in order to preserve financial stability.},

  abstract = {m poucos meses a situa\c{c}\~ao da economia brasileira sofreu uma brusca inflex\~ao. J\'a hav\'iamos avan\c{c}ado bastante no segundo semestre de 2016 e parecia que a economia mergulhava ainda mais fundo na maior crise eco-n\^omica da hist\'oria republicana, sem perspectivas de encontrar uma luz no fim do t\'unel. No in\'icio de 2017, contudo, o horizonte econ\^omico se abriu e a eco-nomia agora ingressa de forma clara num processo de recupera\c{c}\~ao. Salvo por novos eventos de excepcional dramaticidade no plano pol\'itico, a economia seguir\'a seu curso de expans\~ao que, provavelmente, ser\'a mais forte em curto e m\'edio prazos do que atualmente se imagina. A continuidade da recupe-ra\c{c}\~ao \'e agora fundamentalmente uma quest\~ao pol\'itica, n\~ao econ\^omica. O debate sobre o que fazer para a economia se recuperar virou, a meu ver, um tema superado. O crucial, a essa altura, \'e voltar os olhos para o futuro, com o foco nas pol\'iticas econ\^omicas e na constru\c{c}\~ao de um modelo de crescimento consistente, evitando os erros cr\'iticos do passado recente. Estamos numa en-cruzilhada e a escolha de um caminho deve definir se vamos finalmente entrar numa rota de crescimento de longo prazo, que nos leve a uma aproxima\c{c}\~ao progressiva do grupo de economias avan\c{c}adas, ou se vamos ser condenados \`a mediocridade dos voos de galinha. O presente texto est\'a dividido em tr\^es partes, fora esta introdu\c{c}\~ao. Na primeira delas faz-se uma interpreta\c{c}\~ao das origens da crise atual que, embora identifique a exist\^encia de m\'ultiplas causas, considera que existe um determi-nante central relacionado \`a inconsist\^encia do modelo econ\^omico adotado desde meados da d\'ecada passada. Esse diagn\'ostico \'e importante para pensar o que fazer para garantir que se transforme a recupera\c{c}\~ao que rec\'em se inicia num pro-cesso de desenvolvimento de longo prazo. Na segunda parte, faz-se uma brev\'is-sima an\'alise do processo de recupera\c{c}\~ao atual. Ao compar\'a-lo com o ocorrido a partir do segundo semestre de 2003, conclui-se que desta vez corre-se o risco de n\~ao ter sequer um ciclo expansivo relativamente longo (como o ocorrido de 2004 a 2011). Caso n\~ao acertemos num modelo de crescimento adequado, muito provavelmente teremos apenas um voo de galinha. A terceira parte con-clui com uma discuss\~ao sint\'etica sobre a natureza das pol\'iticas requeridas para garantir que ingressemos num verdadeiro ciclo de desenvolvimento sustentado. A recess\~ao dos \'ultimos tr\^es anos j\'a pode ser considerada como a mais Para que desta vez seja diferente ESTUDOS AVAN\c{C}ADOS 31 (89), 2017 112 profunda crise em mais de cem anos (Tabela 1). Com ela foi-se o sonho do cres-cimento robusto, sustentado e socialmente justo, que o pa\'is alimentou durante alguns anos \textendash{} do meio da d\'ecada passada ao in\'icio da atual. De fato, quando consideramos o ciclo completo, do in\'icio da expans\~ao, em 2004, ao fundo da crise em 2016, o crescimento anual m\'edio foi de 2,5\%, nada muito distante da quase estagna\c{c}\~ao em que o pa\'is se encontrava desde o in\'icio da d\'ecada de 1990.

This paper discusses the points of convergence and complementarities between the fuzzy logic and the theory of behavior based on limited rationality and rule-guided economic behavior.},

  abstract = {Was the growth in income inequality a direct driver of the growth in US household debt levels ahead of the 2007\textendash 2008 financial crisis? I study the link between income inequality and US households' consumption and saving decisions, by exploiting multiple microdata sources and constructing measures of geographical variation in top incomes over time. I show that the relationship between consumption and saving rates of low and middle-income American households appears to be strongly mediated by the role of homeownership and rising house prices. The consumption response to changes in top incomes is insignificant throughout this decade, but is significantly higher for homeowners than for renters. Homeowners also accumulate more debt in response to a change in top incomes, albeit exclusively in the form of mortgages. Furthermore, the concentration of income in the top two deciles of the distribution is positively correlated with the growth in values of owner occupied houses. These results indicate that the cost, wealth and collateral effects affecting homeowners living in high-inequality areas may provide an alternative explanation for the link between rising income inequality and the growth in household leverage, insofar explained on the basis of a consumption emulation mechanism.},

Empirical results indicate, however, that housing demand can diverge from the existing supply for several years due to the slow adjustment of the residential capital stock to shocks. In the short run, the market therefore has to be cleared by price adjustments. And indeed, it can be shown empirically that changes in prices are significantly and strongly dependent on the level of stock imbalances. Furthermore, housing prices prove to be an important determinant of residential investment, which in turn drives the adjustment process of the residential capital stock towards its desired level.},

  abstract = {Income and wealth inequality in the United States are at historical highs. This paper introduces data from historical waves of the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) for the entire post-WW2 period from 1949 to 2013. The new data allow us to add important new aspects to the inequality debate. As the historical household surveys cover the entire balance sheet of households, we can study income and wealth inequality jointly. The data gives us a detailed picture of inequality trends among the bottom 90 \%. We document a substantial hollowing out of the middle class as income and wealth concentration at the top was accompanied by losses concentrated in the middle of the distribution. For the first time we can directly contrast the evolution of income and wealth inequality. We show that the income inequality rose earlier and more strongly. We explain this finding by differences in household portfolios. The typical middle-class portfolio is both highly concentrated in housing and highly leveraged. Until the crisis, rising house prices compensated for relative income losses and the growing concentration of financial wealth at the top. Rising middle-class housing wealth gains mitigated the rise in wealth inequality relative to income inequality. The documented differential trends in the evolution of income and wealth inequality provide important information to discriminate between different sources of rising inequality in structural macroeconomic models. Our results highlight the importance of price effects and differences in portfolio composition to understand trends in wealth inequality.},

I find that both methods are suboptimal. Explaining the outcome of high women's representation, fsQCA suggests complex configurations of conditions with low empirical coverage and high sensitivity to coding. While, not without shortcomings, OLS regression analysis performs somewhat better than fsQCA. On the one hand, this method identifies two statistically significant and substantively relevant variables (i.e. quota rules and communist regimes), which strongly increase the percentage of women deputies. On the other hand, the model's interpretation is not completely clear cut, as scholars may disagree over the relevance of the one marginally statistically and substantively significant variable, the longevity of democracy.},

Second, the housing boom hypothesis argues that increasing property prices encourage household spending and household borrowing due to wealth effects, eased credit constraints and the prospect of future capital gains. Third, the low interest hypothesis argues that low interest rates encouraged households to take on more debt.

The paper tests these hypotheses by estimating the determinants of household borrowing using a panel of 11 OECD countries (1980-2011). Results indicate that real estate prices and low interest rates were the most important drivers of household debt.

Minsky's work has inspired a growing body of literature on theoretical business cycle models, but relatively little work has been done in the empirical field. In particular, while interest in financial cycles has risen significantly after the 2007-8 financial crash, and recent empirical studies have explored the impact of debt on aggregate demand or its effect on the probability of financial crises, the literature does not test for endogenous cycle mechanisms. In contrast, the present paper investigates econometrically whether or not business cycles are driven by corporate debt and/or by mortgage debt. We estimate simple vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) models, using historical macroeconomic data for the USA (1889-2015) and the UK (1882-2010). We find robust evidence of endogenous corporate debt-driven cycles for the USA, weak evidence of mortgage debt-driven cycles in the USA and no evidence of corporate or mortgage debt-driven cycles for the UK.},

The paper discusses changes in investment behaviour, consumption behaviour and government expenditures, investigating to what extent changes are related to financialization. Households experience higher debt levels. Rising profits of businesses come with only moderate investment. The notion of a ``finance-dominated'' accumulation regime is proposed to highlight that financial developments crucially shape the pattern and the pace of accumulation. The finance dominated accumulation regime is characterized by a mediocre growth performance and by higher volatility. However, so far deregulated financial markets have not lead to major financial crises in advanced capitalist economies. A possible reason for this is that the size of the state sector has not been substantially reduced despite neoliberal attempts to do so.},

This paper gives a partial update on advances in Kalecki-Minsky modelling. First, theoretically, it discusses the notion of pseudo-Goodwin cycles. Second, it presents empirical findings on endogenous debt cycles. Third, it reviews evidence of the relative size of distributional and financial effects on demand. Fourth, it reports results on the drivers of household debt.},

  abstract = {The Bhaduri\textendash Marglin model has become a widely used workhorse model in heterodox macroeconomics and has given rise to two dozen or so empirical studies, which at times have given conflicting results. Neo-Kaleckians and neo-Goodwinians have applied different estimation strategies, with the former typically estimating behavioural equations, while the latter have often used reduced-form demand equations. Further differences include the lag structure, the output measure, the control variables and the sample. This paper, first, tries to clarify the terms of the debate. While neo-Kaleckians interpret the model as a medium-term, partial-equilibrium goods market model, neo-Goodwinians are interested in the interaction of demand and distribution and regard the model as a long-run model with short-run cycles. Second, we elaborate a Kaleckian\textendash Minskyan view of the economy as characterised by a wage-led demand regime and cycles driven by financial fragility. Many of the reported results may suffer from omitted variable bias as they do not include financial control variables. At least in the recent past, financial effects on demand have been much larger in size than distribution effects. A wage-led Minsky model with a reserve-army distribution function gives rise to pseudo-Goodwin cycles.},

  abstract = {This study aims to deepen the understanding of the psychological processes involved in the formation of change-supportive intentions by adopting a configurational perspective. To investigate potential configurations in relevant psychological processes suggested by the theory of planned behaviour (Ajzen, ), classical linear analytic methods are supplemented by the application of two case-centred methods: latent profile analysis (LPA) and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The study uses data from two measurement times drawing on employees of a city council (t1: N\,=\,1,589; t2: N\,=\,1,524) undergoing complex and continuous organisational changes. While the case-centred results from LPA and fsQCA generally accord well with the results from regression analysis, they consistently highlight the relevance of configurational patterns. Specifically, LPA and fsQCA reveal that different combinations of change-related attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control relate to the presence or absence of high supportive intentions. These results provide valuable insights for fostering employees' change-supportive intentions. Moreover, the present study demonstrates that case-centred analytical methods can essentially enrich research and theory-building in change management as well as in the field of behavioural intention formation in general.},

We use the housing price component independent of firms\^a\texteuro\texttrademark{} investment opportunity and credit supply shocks, obtained by historical decomposition of a structural VAR, as the key explanatory variable. The baseline results support the existence of the collateral channel as housing price growth and firm investment exhibit a positive relationship. This collateral channel is more distinct for capital expenditure than R\&D spending, and in housing market downturns than booms. Another notable finding is that despite the collateral channel, large housing price booms are detrimental to investment, which suggests a possible reallocation of resources from the production sector to the housing sector during those phases. Moreover, various firm-specific and country-specific characteristics are found to affect the housing price-investment relationship. Small firms and firms with stronger investment opportunities respond more sensitively to housing price shocks. Countries that rely more on bank financing, collateralized lending, and with higher LTV restraint, display a larger collateral effect in capital expenditure.},

However, what remains unclear is how a well-functioning TMT is formed to effectively achieve the desired internationalization goal. Utilizing a unique sample of Chinese banking and finance institutions' initial public offering overseas, this study explores how Chinese BFIs configure the leader-TMT dynamics to achieve high internationalization performance. Using a set-theoretic approach and the technique of fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, a distinct taxonomy of the leader-TMT dynamics (namely, grass-root, strategic executor, born-global and glocal) is developed. Our findings provide novel insights into the IHRM variations within Chinese BFIs' TMT formation, based on a theoretically and methodologically extended leader-TMT dynamics perspective.},

The alternative nonneoclassical conflict-augmented Phillips curve assumes no labour scarcity, cost-push inflation and that expectations are not always fully passed on to nominal wages. Additionally, this alternative is also more general than the Heterodox-NAIRU models, as it is compatible both with stable and accelerating inflation, depending on the strength of the workers' bargaining power.},

It finds that Ordos City's neoliberal financial governance, featuring excessive deregulation, active public\textendash private partnerships, market-friendly and growth-chasing institutional restructuring, land financialization, and enthusiastic state investment, has significantly contributed to the city's real estate boom and overbuilding. In Ordos City's post-bubble period, although preferential financial policies and deregulation persist, neoliberal financial governance has been largely curbed through reinforced governance and enhanced welfare and redistributive policy efforts such as the Housing Exchange Program. This article reiterates the essence of China's neoliberal governance and verifies the existence of neoliberal governance in Ordos City. It also showcases the resilience of neoliberal local governing strategies in China. Nevertheless, the post-neoliberal endeavors in Ordos City, characterized by reinforced welfare and redistributive measures, and timely and effective state intervention via rigorous governance and enhanced public ownership of real estate assets for redistribution, add critical insights to the global intellectual and practical quests for post-neoliberal possibilities. Finally, this study calls for combined efforts of sustainable development policy initiatives, effective policy implementation, rigorous governance, and a mindset of sustainability for all to combat neoliberalism.},

We find a surprisingly important role for short-term interest rates as a driver of house prices, especially outside the United States. Our interpretation is that this reflects the importance of the bank lending channel of monetary policy in house price fluctuations, especially in countries where securitisation of home mortgages is less prevalent. In addition, we document substantial inertia in house prices and find that changes in interest rates and other determinants affect house prices gradually rather than on impact. This suggests that modest cuts in policy rates are not likely to rapidly fuel house price increases. Finally, we find that US interest rates seem to affect house prices outside the United States.},

Interactions between wealth accumulation and income are a vital driver of inequality in capitalist economies. But not enough is known about which types of wealth are more conducive to sustained improvements in household's position in the income distribution. This paper contributes to the literature by estimating how accumulation of different forms of wealth influences income inequality. Using linear regression analysis and non-parametric median slope estimation with data from the U.S. Survey of Consumer Finances between 1989-2013, we find a statistically significant relationship between household balance sheet composition and position in the distribution of income relative to the median. Greater share of primary residence and low- yielding transaction accounts in total asset portfolio, and higher contribution of unsecured debt to overall debt holdings are found to push households away from the median towards the bottom of the income distribution. Higher relative accumulation of business equity, high-yielding financial investment assets, secured debt, retirement and insurance assets, and other property are found to pull households further away from the median towards the top of the income distribution. The latter effects are found not to be shared equally across gender, racial, and intergenerational groups.},

  abstract = {To promote the financial stability, there is a need for an early warning system to signal the formation of asset price misalignments. This research provides two novel methods to accomplish this task. Results in this research shows that the conventional unit root tests in modified forms can be used to construct early warning indicators for bubbles in financial markets. More precisely, the conventional augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test is shown to provide a basis for two novel bubble indicators. These new indicators are tested via MC simulations to analyze their ability to signal emerging unit roots in time series and to compare their power with standard stability and unit root tests. Simulation results concerning these two new stability tests are promising: they seem to be more robust and to have more power in the presence of changing persistence than the standard stability and unit root tests. When these new tests are applied to real US stock market data starting from 1871, they are able to signal most of the consensus bubbles, defined as stock market booms for example by the IMF, and they also flash warning signals far ahead of a crash. Also encouraging are the results with these methods in practical applications using equity prices in the UK, Finland and China as the methods seem to be able to signal most of the consensus bubbles from the data. Finally, these early warning indicators are applied to data for several housing markets. In most of the cases the indicators seem to work relatively well, indicating bubbles before the periods which, according to the consensus literature, are seen as periods of sizeable upward or downward movements. The scope of application of these early warning indicators could be wide. They could be used eg to help determine the right timing for the start of a monetary tightening cycle or for an increase in countercyclical capital buffers.},

This finding reflects a financialization process of commodities markets and helps explain the synchronized price boom and bust of a broad set of seemingly unrelated commodities in the US in 2006-2008. In contrast, such commodity price comovements were absent in China, which refutes growing commodity demands from emerging economies as the driver.},

We analyze model output using a series of macro-scale economic and landscape pattern measures, including land rent gradients estimated using simple regression models.  We first demonstrate that our model replicates relevant theoretical results of the traditional Alonso/Von Th\"unen model (structural validation). We then explore how urban morphology and land rents change as the relative market power of buyers and sellers changes (i.e., we move from a 'sellers' market' to a 'buyers' market').  We demonstrate that these strategic price dynamics have differential effects on land rents, but both lead to increased urban expansion.},

Its medium run is built around Marx\textendash Goodwin cycles of demand and distribution. Long-run income and wealth distributions follow rules of accumulation stated by Pasinetti in combination with a technical progress function for labour productivity growth incorporating a Kaldor effect and induced innovation. An explicit steady state solution is presented along with analysis of dynamics. When wage income of capitalist households is introduced, the Samuelson\textendash Modigliani steady state `dual' to Pasinetti's cannot be stable. Numerical simulation loosely based on US data suggests that the long-run growth rate is around 2\% per year and that the capitalist share of wealth may rise from about 40 to 70\% due to positive medium-term feedback of higher wealth inequality into its own growth.},

Sources and uses of incomes are disaggregated by household groups including the top 1 percent. Their importance (including saving rates) differs markedly across households. The SAM reveals two transfer flows exceeding 10 percent of GDP via fiscal (broadly progressive) and financial (regressive) channels. A third major flow over time has been a ten percentage point increase in the GDP share of the top 1 percent. A simulation model is used to illustrate how `feasible' modifications to tax/transfer programs and increasing low wages cannot offset the historical redistribution toward the well-to-do.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we build a fully specified parsimonious Sraffian supermultiplier stockflow consistent model (SSM-SFC) with two non-capacity creating autonomous expenditures: residential investment and debt-financed consumption. Our model represents a closed economy without government with workers and capitalists households and only the latter are not credit constrained. The introduction of residential investment implies that our SSM-SFC model has two real assets: firms' productive capital and households' real estate. In our model, residential investment growth rate responds to changes of house price inflation. The numerical simulation experiments shows that our model keeps the main standard Sraffian supermultiplier growth models results. As a particular result, an increase of residential investment growth rate implies a decrease of real estate share in total real assets. Inspired by the recent U.S. bubble episode, we plug house price inflation data (1992-2019) into our model. Although simple, our numerical simulations are capable to reproduce some stylized facts such as residential investment leading the business cycle and capital accumulation and a clockwise pattern between non-capacity creating autonomous expenditures and capacity utilization rate.},

Two important factors in this crisis have been the selective reporting of results and methodological problems. In this article, we examine a fusion of these two factors. More specifically, we demonstrate that the uncritical import of Boolean optimization algorithms from electrical engineering into some areas of the social sciences in the late 1980s has induced algorithmic bias on a considerable scale over the last quarter century. Potentially affected are all studies that have used a method nowadays known as Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). Drawing on replication material for 215 peer-reviewed QCA articles from across 109 high-profile management, political science and sociology journals, we estimate the extent this problem has assumed in empirical work. Our results suggest that one in three studies is affected, one in ten severely so. More generally, our article cautions scientists against letting methods and algorithms travel too easily across disparate disciplines without sufficient prior evaluation of their suitability for the context in hand.},

In a recent contribution to Quality \& Quantity, Denk and Lehtinen (Qual Quant 48(6):3475\textendash 3487, 2014) present Comparative Multilevel Analysis (CMA) as an innovative method whereby the effects of contexts on outcomes of interest can be studied configurationally if combined with Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). In contradistinction, I argue that CMA is neither innovative in nor necessary for ascertaining the influence of context in a configurational-comparative manner. QCA is appreciably more powerful than the authors acknowledge and provides all required functionality. In repetition of Rohlfing's (Int J Soc Res Methodol 15(6):497\textendash 506, 2012) verdict on Denk's (Int J Soc Res Methodol 13(1):29\textendash 39, 2010) earlier version of CMA, I conclude that QCA need not be extended in the direction proposed by Denk and Lehtinen. Researchers interested in the contextual analysis of configurational data are well-served by the existing toolbox of QCA.},

Existing studies in this area rely on the technique of               exhaustive enumeration               , and the majority of works examine the reactivity of QCA either only to alterations in discretionary parameter values or only to data quality. In this article, we introduce the technique of               combinatorial computation               for evaluating the interaction effects between two problems afflicting data quality and two discretionary parameters on the stability of QCA reference solutions. In this connection, we challenge a hitherto unstated assumption intrinsic to exhaustive enumeration, show that combinatorial computation permits the formulation of general laws of sensitivity in QCA, and demonstrate that our technique is most efficient.},

  abstract = {Qualitative small-N comparisons face the challenge to detect context-bound causality under conditions of limited empirical diversity. Rather than treating context as a causal factor, we test the usefulness of the novel method of comparative multilevel analysis (CMA) to identify and understand the role of context as a contingent necessary condition that enables a causal relationship to unfold. Combining CMA with pairwise comparisons, we assess how organ donation policies in Switzerland and Spain affect relatives' refusal rates in a small-N setting exhibiting multiple contextual levels. To tackle limited diversity systematically, we suggest to refine the CMA methodology by accounting for several contexts and referring to higher-order constructs. Applying CMA with these refinements, we find voluntary information measures only affect refusal rates in contexts of a credible state explicitly supporting organ donation. The fact that CMA can easily be combined with other analytical and conceptual approaches makes it an effective technique to identify contextual effects in small-N research.},

  abstract = {We revisit the old but still vibrant Post-Keynesian debate over "fully-adjusted positions", defined by the long-run equality of actual and standard utilisation rates. The central proposition of this paper is that in a world where different groups inside and outside firms have different objectives, the equality of actual and standard utilisation should not be treated as the (only possible) long-run equilibrium condition. The argument is illustrated in a model of target return pricing with conflict inflation, building on Lavoie (2002, 2003). A "common language" for the conflicting claims by shareholders, managers, workers and banks is developed in terms of target profit rates, and it is shown that these contradictory claims can be partly reconciled through variations in the utilisation rate. The analysis unifies history and equilibrium in the sense that the nature of and the adjustment to the final equilibrium position depends on the objectives of the dominant social groups. We distinguish a "Fordist regime" and a "financialisation regime" and produce simulation results within a simple stock-flow consistent model that are broadly consistent with the stylised facts of these distinct historical phases of capitalism.},

  abstract = {"Adair Turner became chairman of Britain's Financial Services Authority just as the global financial crisis struck in 2008, and he played a leading role in redesigning global financial regulation. In this eye-opening book, he sets the record straight about what really caused the crisis. It didn't happen because banks are too big to fail--our addiction to private debt is to blame. Between Debt and the Devil challenges the belief that we need credit growth to fuel economic growth, and that rising debt is okay as long as inflation remains low. In fact, most credit is not needed for economic growth--but it drives real estate booms and busts and leads to financial crisis and depression. Turner explains why public policy needs to manage the growth and allocation of credit creation, and why debt needs to be taxed as a form of economic pollution. Banks need far more capital, real estate lending must be restricted, and we need to tackle inequality and mitigate the relentless rise of real estate prices. Turner also debunks the big myth about fiat money--the erroneous notion that printing money will lead to harmful inflation. To escape the mess created by past policy errors, we sometimes need to monetize government debt and finance fiscal deficits with central-bank money. Between Debt and the Devil shows why we need to reject the assumption that private credit is essential to growth and fiat money is inevitably dangerous. Each has its advantages, and each creates risks that public policy must consciously balance. "--},

Statistical methodologies tend to draw on probabilistic understandings of causality. Qualitative research traditions, however, have advanced a sophisticated framework around necessary and sufficient conditions. In particular, the qualitative comparative analysis approach has embraced theory development that emphasizes equifinality and complex causal relationships. This article reviews the two traditions and explores how a causal framework grounded in necessary and sufficient conditions can be adapted to statistical models. A logistic regression analysis of major contributions to peacekeeping missions is used to illustrate both the viability of blending the two traditions as well as the potential for more sophisticated theory development and testing.},

The influence of the Presidencies is compared through qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), which aims to identify necessary and sufficient conditions for influence to occur. The results show that there is only one necessary condition for the Presidency to exert influence, that is, the issue should be highly salient to the incumbent Member State. The absence of any other condition for influence does as such not hamper Presidency influence. Moreover, the analysis reveals three sufficient combinations of conditions for Presidency influence, in which the individual conditions play different roles. The application of QCA to Presidency influence leads to novel insights and stimulates conceptual clarity on the level of and the conditions for influence.},

  abstract = {During the global housing boom that preceded the 2007\textendash 9 financial crisis, household debt increased substantially in many European countries, posing a challenge for literature on financialization and the institutional heterogeneity of mortgage markets. This paper examines recent institutional shifts in European mortgage markets and specifies three analytically distinct models of debt accumulation: inclusion, extension and intensity. While existing research has emphasized inclusion (access to homeownership), we show that financial intensification is an important determinant of cross-national variation in debt. We assess the variation in financial intensity in six European countries (France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain) using household-level survey data. Our results show that inclusion and expansion explain only part of the cross-national variation in mortgage debt to income ratios. Furthermore, household financial behavior is consistent with the financial intensity model, and variation in the degree of financial intensification explains a substantial portion of the cross-national difference in debt levels.},

  abstract = {Understanding mortgage markets requires understanding the changing roles of and the competition between the primary and secondary markets. A description of the competitive structure of the mortgage market can be summarized as one of dueling charters. Of the two major charters in the industry, one is for depositories (banks and thrifts), which have been traditionally identified as the primary market, and the other is for the government-sponsored enterprises (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac), which operate a secondary market. However, the distinction between primary and secondary markets has grown less important than that between charters. Today there are basically two different ways (e.g., via a bank or via Freddie Mac) of moving money from the capital markets to the mortgage market. The competitive balance in the industry depends on which charter's route is cheaper, primarily in terms of fund-raising and controlling risk. The competition between the charters can be modeled as the balance between the lower costs of the secondary market and the selection advantages of the primary market. This article develops a framework for understanding the evolution and structure of American mortgage markets by modeling this balance and discussing how it has changed over time.},

The detailed age-structured compartment-based model endogenously captures various disease transmission pathways, expanding significantly from the standard SEIR model. The model is customized for India by using the appropriate population pyramid, contact rate matrices, external arrivals (as per actual data), and a few other calibrated fractions based on the reported cases of Covid-19 in India. Also, we have explicitly modeled, using independent time-variant levers, the effects of testing, contact tracing, isolating Covid-positive patients, quarantining, use of mask/better hygiene practices, social distancing through contact rate reductions at distinct zones of home(H), work(W), school(S) and other(O) locations. Simulation results show that, even after an extended lock-down, some non-trivial number of infections (even asymptomatic) will be left and the pandemic will resurface. Only tools that work against the pandemic is high rate of testing of those who show Covid-19 like symptoms, isolating them if they are positive and contact tracing all contacts of positive patients and quarantining them, in combination with use of face masks and personal hygiene. A wide range of combination of effectiveness of contact tracing, isolation, quarantining and personal hygiene measures help minimize the pandemic impact and some imperfections in implementation of one measure can be compensated by better implementation of other measures.},

However, because this type of aggregation bias mainly produces ambivalent subset relationships between the condition(s) and the outcome, such false positives do not pose a problem for the fsQCA results               per se               . The aggregation bias has a negative impact on fsQCA analysis only because the consistency score is not able to detect set-theoretic subset relationships. Indeed, the existent parameter of consistency does not distinguish whether the subset relationship between conditions and outcome is the result of the mere Boolean minimization or whether it has set-theoretic significance. This article proposes a new consistency formula that provides information about subset relationships between conditions and outcome and detects the difference between randomly-generated subsets and meaningful subset relationships. The new parameter of consistency proposed here can be considered as an additional tool to test the significance of a meaningful sufficient relationship without being subject to the aggregation bias.},

However, this formula fails to determine empirical relevance from the analysis of sufficiency because it does not consider the set-theoretic information contained in each fuzzy value. The inaccuracies are primarily due to the inability of the coverage formula to fully grasp the quantifiable and qualitative dimensions of the concept of coverage. In this article, the author proposes a new calculation of coverage able to aggregate the quantifiable and qualitative analytical dimension of coverage in fuzzy terms.},

In its original form, QCA is relatively static and does not analyze configurations over time. Since many key questions in political science \textendash{} and other social sciences \textendash{} have a temporal dimension, this is a major drawback of QCA. Therefore, we discuss and compare three QCA-related strategies that enable researchers to track configurations over time: (1) Multiple Time Periods, Single QCA; (2) Multiple QCAs, Different Time Periods; and (3) Fuzzy-Set Ideal Type Analysis. We use existing datasets to empirically demonstrate and visualize the strategies. By comparing the strategies, we also contribute to existing overviews on how to address time in QCA. We conclude by formulating an agenda for the further development of the three strategies in applied research, in political science and beyond.},

Given the heterogeneous order of integration of the variables involved, the paper employs recently developed robust econometric methodologies, such as the bounds testingARDL approach, to examine the existence of a long-run relationship, and the LA-VAR causality analysis, to confirm the direction of causality.

Income inequality and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita has been associated to stroke mortality in developed countries. In LMIC, GDP per capita is considered to be a more relevant health determinant than income inequality. This study aims to investigate if income inequality is associated to stroke mortality in Brazil at large, but also on regional and state levels, and whether GDP per capita modulates the impact of this association. METHODS: Stroke mortality rates, Gini index and GDP per capita data were pooled for the 2002 to 2009 period from public available databases. Random effects models were fitted, controlling for GDP per capita and other covariates. RESULTS: Income inequality was independently associated to stroke mortality rates, even after controlling for GDP per capita and other covariates. GDP per capita reduced only partially the impact of income inequality on stroke mortality. A decrease in 10 points in the Gini index was associated with 18\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} decrease in the stroke mortality rate in Brazil.

Our findings contribute to a further understanding of health inequalities in Brazil. The demonstrated synergism between state, neighborhood and individual level determinants of health supports inter-sectoral policies and interventions in a clearly multileveled way.},

  abstract = {Latin America is the most unequal region in the world. The current sustainable development agenda increased attention to health inequity and its determinants in the region. Our aim is to investigate the social gradient in health in Latin America and assess the effects of social capital and income inequality on it. We used cross-sectional data from the World Values Survey and the World Bank. Our sample included 10,426 respondents in eight Latin American countries. Self-rated health was used as the outcome. Education level was the socioeconomic position indicator. We measured social capital by associational membership, civic participation, generalized trust, and neighborhood trust indicators at both individual and country levels. Income inequality was operationalized using the Gini index at country-level. We employed fixed effects logistic regressions and cross-level interactions to assess the impact of social capital and income inequality on the heath gradient, controlling for country heterogeneity. Education level was independently associated with self-rated health, representing a clear social gradient in health, favoring individuals in higher socioeconomic positions. Generalized and neighborhood trust at country-level moderated the effect on the association between socioeconomic position and health, yet favoring individuals in lower socioeconomic positions, especially in lower inequality countries, despite their lower individual social capital. Our findings suggest that collective rather than individual social capital can impact the social gradient in health in Latin America, explaining health inequalities.},

The main difference with ``crisp-set'' QCA is that in mvQCA, the conditions can have more values than just the Boolean values 0 and 1, whereas the main difference with ``fuzzy-set'' QCA is that mvQCA conditions remain discrete. The major advantage of nondichotomous categorization, according to its proponents, is that it reduces the likelihood of contradictory configurations because of a more homogeneous grouping of cases. We give an overview of existing mvQCA applications, with a detailed discussion of two recent publications, and argue that crisp-set and fuzzy-set alternatives should be less easily discarded, as the mvQCA solution comes with substantial set-theoretical costs.},

The set-theoretical technique fsQCA makes statements in kind (e.g., ``a condition or configuration is necessary or not for an outcome''), thereby ignoring the variation in degree. We propose to apply a recently developed technique for identifying relationships of necessity that can make both statements in kind and in degree, thus making full use of variation in the data: Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA). With its ability to also make statements in degree (``a specific level of a condition is necessary or not for a specific level of the outcome''), NCA can complement the in kind analysis of necessity with fsQCA.},

Given that ALMPs are usually expensive and unlikely to win a government many votes, this study hypothesizes that an improving socio-economic situation is a necessary condition for increased spending. On the basis of the data of 53 governments from 18 established democracies between 1985 and 2003, the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis shows that there are different combinations of conditions, or routes, toward activation and that an improving socio-economic situation is needed for each of them. Specifically, the analysis reveals that governments activate under decreasing unemployment combined with (1) trade openness, or (2) the absence of corporatism in the case of leftist governments, or (3) the presence of corporatism in the case of rightist governments. These findings advance our understanding of the politics of labor market reform.},

Highlights of the vast literature on bubbles, crashes, and volatility are surveyed and a promising direction for future research, based on a theory of short-side rationing, is described. The theory suggests that, especially in extreme market conditions, marginal quantities held or not held become transactionally more important than the prices paid or received. Our approach is empirically implemented by fitting monthly elasticity of return variances to an exponential expression. From this follows a comparison of changes in implied versus realized volatility, generation of an extreme events line (EEL), and a crash intensity comparison metric. These methods open a new perspective from which it is possible to analyze bubble and crash events as applied to different time scales and asset classes that include bonds, real estate, foreign exchange, and commodities.},

QCA is a case-study methodology that enables researchers to compare mid-sized numbers of cases in view of sufficiency and necessity set relations. It is especially suitable for the assessment of ``if\ldots{} then'' hypotheses. It takes into account complex causal structures, referring to equifinality, conjunctural causation, and asymmetrical causality. With the fuzzy set version, it is also possible to work with those concepts which are dichotomous in nature, but which can then be more finely grained; these kinds of concepts are very typical for the social sciences in general and for social movement research in particular. The contribution also gives some examples for applied QCAs in social movement research.},

During the last \ldots fty years three counter-clockwise trajectories of home prices, residential investment, household debt and real mortgage interest rates can be observed. Those and further stylized facts get simulated via stock-\textdaggerdbl ow consistent interactions of a Marshallian housing market, a household sector, a banking sector, a government sector and a goods market. Some tentative conclusions can be drawn (1) The longrun e\textcurrency ect of a higher minimum equity reduces output volatility, but the impact e\textcurrency ect is de\textdaggerdbl ationary. (2) Fiscal policy focusing on stabilizing the government debt to GDP ratio is destabilizing, counter-cyclical \ldots scal policy lowers output volatility. (3) Lower capital gain and/or corporate tax rates raise output volatility. (4) Swift counter-cyclical reaction of monetary policy to deviations from targets by adjusting the short-term fund rate is necessary, but not su\textcent{} cient for stability, as the `pass through'to long-term interest rates is crucial. (5) Enforcing stricter/softer sectorial creditworthiness criteria vis-a-vis home buyers during the boom/recession reduces output and home price volatility and might be superior to pure interest policy.},

Theoretically, risk element cannot be directly inserted in the standard housing models because most of the models are built on the underlying assumption of certainty. Extending the life-cycle model to a two-asset expected utility case with uncertainty, we show house price is affected by housing market risk premium, which is a function of households' risk-aversion coefficient, real housing wealth, and expected housing volatility. Empirical analysis relying on China's 2001\textendash 2018 provincial housing panel data supports the theoretical innovation. Despite the empirical results show that the effect of housing market risk on house price is tiny, simulations suggest that the consideration of risk is quite helpful in analyzing and predicting the long-run house price equilibriums.},

The key point is that a person is rational about her/his private information until her/his private information is confirmed by a clearly defined market signal. Using a pre-sale as a mechanism of updating a developer's beliefs, this paper analyzes the impact of over-confidence on overbuilding and cycles in real estate markets. Our finding indicates that a pre-sale activity will increase the magnitude of over-building and over-confidence will increase the volatility in real estate markets. Our model also has implications to the well-established literature dealing with the issue of over-capacity in many industrial sectors.},

@techreport{wattEXPLAININGUNEMPLOYMENTDEVELOPMENTS2017,
  title = {{{EXPLAINING UNEMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENTS IN EUROPE}}},
  author = {Watt, Andrew},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {This  study  seeks  to  explain  unemployment  patterns  in  western  European  countries  prior  to  the  Great  Recession.   Criticising the standard view that good unemployment performance is primarily due to liberal labour market institutions,  the  argument  advanced  here  is  that  different  unemployment  trajectories  can  be  explained  by  the  different  ability  or   willingness of policymakers in the countries, at different points in time, to influence two key variables: nominal aggr e- gate demand and nominal  wages. In a mixture of theoretical and empirical analysis, the scope for, the constraints on,  and the institutional and structural prerequisites for policymakers to exert influence on nominal output and wages are  identified.  Time  series  analysis  suggests  t hat  countries  that  ensure  or  experience  relatively  stable  growth  of  nominal   output  or  demand  and  (less  so)  wage  variables  enjoy  better  labour  market  performance  (especially  since  1981).  On   the other hand, given demand/output volatility, an adaptive wage st rategy might be desirable.  A  fuzzy  set  qualitative  comparative  analysis  (fsQCA )  is  conducted  for  OECD  countries  for  three  twelve- year  periods:   1970- 1981,  1982- 1993  and  1994 -2005.  Main  findings  include:  Coordinated  collective  wage  bargaining  and  flexible   labour  market  institutions  constitute  functional  equivalents.  The  former  perform ed  better  in  the  first  two  periods,  the   latter in the third period. In the anti -inflationary struggle characterising the second period, there is strong evidence that  a  lack   of  collective  wage  setting  was  associated  with  particularly  poor  labour  market  perf ormance,  and  somewhat   weaker evidence that its  presence  helped deliver relatively good performance. From a longitudinal perspective mone- tary  policies  oriented  towards  employment  are  closely  associated  with  favourable  unemployment  trends;  cross - sectionally  the picture is more complex, however. In most specifications counter -cyclical fiscal or monetary policies to  stabilise  demand  prove  favourable  to  labour  market  outcomes.  Almost  no  systematic  relationship  between  labour   market performance and the degree of openness of an economy was found.  Overall the findings of this analysis suggest that the existing literature has unjustifiably focused, in a one- sided man- ner,  on  the  importance  of  liberal  labour  market  institutions,  while  it  has  underplayed  the  role  for  both  employment - oriented macroeconomic policies and coordinated wage- setting.},

Empirical evidence is supportive of the hypothesis that land-related bank loans have been a major determinant of Japanese net long-term foreign investment. the hypothesis of substitution between direct and indirect foreign investment also receives support, and areas of future research are mentioned.},

  abstract = {During the course of the 1980s three major 'anomalies' were observed in a number of countries, including in Japan, which threw doubt on the traditional macroeconomic models: 1. The apparent velocity decline in the quantity equation and the resulting instability of the money demand function; 2. unusually fast rises in asset prices that often came to be referred to as speculative bubbles and which could not be explained by standard asset pricing models; and 3. capital exports from Japan, which reached historic proportions in the mid-1980s, but collapsed in the early 1990s, and which could not be explained by traditional models. In this article I present a simple model that encompasses the standard theory as a special case and which simultaneously can account for the above three 'anomalies'. It is based on a 'quantity equation' of credit creation, which is disaggregated into credit for 'financial circulation' and credit for the 'real circulation'. It is shown that excessive credit creation for financial circulation is responsible for all three 'anomalies'. The model is supported in empirical tests using the general to specific econometric methodology and using Japanese data. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for monetary theory, future research and economic policy.},

(2005), Demirg\"u\c{c}-Kunt and Detragiache (2005), Werner (2005), Beck et al. (2006), and Reinhart and Rogoff (2008). Secondly, I aim to gain insights into the link between the banking sector and the economy (which are again of importance for both theory and policy). This is an important topic that has slowly but steadily grown to a substantial body of literature. Many authors recognise that banks are `special' in some way (Fama, 1985, Bossone, 1999, James and Smith, 2000, Ashcraft, 2005), and that the link between the banking sector and the economy is of great importance (King and Levine, 1996, Levine, 1997). However, the precise details of just what makes banks special, as well as the precise nature of their link to the economy have remained unclear or at least disputed. Analysing crises may help elucidate these issues.},

It is also necessary for the finance and banking literature to consider how best to incorporate systemic, macroeconomic feedbacks into its modelling of financial intermediation. Thus a new research programme on the link between banking and the economy is needed. This special issue is devoted to this theme. In this paper an overview of the issues and problems in the economics and finance literature is presented, and a concrete, simple approach is identified of how to incorporate banks into a macroeconomic model that solves many of these issues. The model distinguishes between the type of credit that boosts GDP and credit that is associated with asset prices and banking crises. The model is consistent with the empirical record. Some applications are discussed, namely the prediction and prevention of banking crises, implications for fiscal policy, and a solution to the European sovereign debt crisis that stimulates growth while avoiding the corner solutions of euro exit or fiscal union.},

  abstract = {The article seeks to advance discussion about the nature of competition and of the `firm' consistent with a classical-Sraffian perspective on relative prices and distribution. Discussion focuses primarily on the work of James Clifton published from the late 1970's. Clifton's insights have a direct bearing on issues at the heart of broader Sraffian research: how relative prices are anchored by the mobility of capital; whether the rate of profit should be interpreted as the exogenous distributive variable in the Sraffian price system; and, the forces which govern the `normal' rate of profit, including the causal significance of the rate of growth. While Clifton's approach lends support to the interpretation of the rate of profit as a target rate of return, the article takes issue with Semmler's explanation as being endogenous to the price system. An alternative exogenous explanation of the target rate by reference to the rate of growth from Eichner is also considered, but rejected, despite the similarities between the insights of Clifton and Eichner into corporate pricing. Some useful implications from Clifton's analysis\textemdash as to the modeling of classical competition and gravitation\textemdash are also drawn out.},

  abstract = {Much qualitative analysis does not employ careful causal inference, and the quantitative alternative cannot be applied successfully where there are few cases, as in the study of social revolution. I apply Boolean algebra to 28 Latin American national cases since 1956, to explain the revolutionary successes in Cuba and Nicaragua and the failures or absence of revolution elsewhere. I reject various one-sided explanations of these patterns, including theories that focus only on the strengths of guerrilla movements or only on United States\&apos; military assistance or its withdrawal. Boolean analysis indicates that the convergence of five elements produced two revolutions in Latin America: (1) the attempt at guerrilla warfare, (2) guerrilla successes in securing high levels of peasant support, (3) guerrilla achievement of substantial military strength, (4) at the national level, the presence of a patrimonial praetorian regime, and (5) the withdrawal of U.S. support for that regime. Revolutionary failure or absence in the region\&apos;s other 26 cases can be reduced to three basic sub-patterns, in which one or more of these five elements were absent.},

Therefore, the German housing system is considered to be operating outside financialized capitalism. Despite Germany's apparent stability, we argue that an alternative trajectory of financialization in the German housing market can be observed. This trajectory has followed three stages or `waves'. The first wave started around the time of German unification and is characterized by the failed attempt of West German banks to marketize and liberalize German housing finance. The second wave started in the late 1990s and is characterized by the `financialized privatization' of many public housing associations and the speculative investments of private equity firms and hedge funds. The third wave started during the global financial crisis and is characterized by booming housing prices and the market entry of listed real estate companies.},

  abstract = {Housing financialization, or the increased dominance of financial markets in the housing sector, has not stopped in the wake of the crisis. Rather, it has reinforced and rescaled itself, expanding into new market segments and urban territories. However, while academic scholarship has convincingly exposed the reconfiguration of financialization processes, it has paid surprisingly little attention to how these processes are also contested from within society and the economy. In response to this gap in the literature, I propose in this contribution a threefold research agenda, calling out for more research on (i) financial market reforms aimed at dismantling finance-led housing accumulation; (ii) policy focused on strengthening the public and affordable housing sector; and (iii) changing modes of urban governance and `anti-political' social movements which can contest housing financialization locally. Taking into account these three fields of inquiry, I invite housing scholars to explore how \textendash{} and if \textendash de-financializing tendencies can become ecologically dominant in post-crisis urban housing markets.},

The research question also includes analyzing the importance of the housing market for the transmission mechanism. We estimate an eight-variable structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model of the Swedish economy over the period 1993 and 2018 using quarterly data, covering both the internet bubble in 2000 and the financial crises in 2008. The results indicate that interest rates have both a direct effect on housing prices and an indirect impact through the bank lending channel. Over time, the traditional interest rate channel importance has been stable. On the other hand, the role of the bank lending channel has increased over time. Household debt has increased substantially in Sweden and elsewhere. That means that the interest rate sensitivity in society has increased. Based on the results, it is possible to evaluate and forecast potential house price effects (both direct and indirect) when the interest rate changes.},

As neither framework accounts for the important macroeconomic influence of house prices and mortgage credit, we suggest the prevailing Comparative Political Economy accounts of the financial sector remain underdeveloped. Through an econometric evaluation of 18 advanced economies from 1980 to 2017, we demonstrate that household debt has larger and more statistically significant effects on GDP growth than business debt, and household debt volumes are largely determined by house price inflation. These results are consistent across the varieties of capitalism and advanced banking systems, suggesting the VoC's focus on corporate finance is misplaced and the macroeconomic effects of household debt and house prices are underappreciated, especially in non-Anglo-American advanced economies.},

  abstract = {In this innovative and very practical book, L. Randall Wray argues that full employment and price stability are not the incompatible goals that current economic theory and policy assume. Indeed, he advances a policy that would generate true, full employment while simultaneously ensuring an even greater degree of price stability than has been achieved in the 1990s.Wray's clearly written argument incorporates incisive historical analysis, modern monetary theory, and an examination of policy alternatives that rises above the doctrinal debates among monetarists, supply-siders and Keynesians over natural or non-inflationary rates of unemployment. Understanding Modern Money proclaims that a labor buffer stock program would guarantee full employment and increase labor productivity and economic growth, while reducing inflationary pressures. Wray's analysis shows that, contrary to popular belief, the dangers of a government budget deficit are largely imaginary. He outlines a program in which the government acts as employer of last resort, thereby providing employment and training to the otherwise unemployed, and stabilizing the wage scale which acts as a brake on inflation. This permits greater price stability without requiring conventional methods such as wage and price controls or countercyclical monetary policy.This ground-breaking book offers important new ways of thinking for policymakers, students, and general readers interested in economics, employment policies, and monetary theory.},

The results show that the effect of housing prices on the consumption of households is significantly positive and the rise of housing price has a stronger effect on the promotion of basic consumption. Further analysis of the differences shows that house prices mainly affect the consumption of high-income families, young and middle-aged families, families with multiple suites, and households in the eastern and central regions. In addition, the intermediary effect test shows that the impact of house prices on consumption is partially transmitted through property income.},

  abstract = {Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) is a technique originally developed by Charles Ragin in the field of political science. It accepts data sets from the problem of interest, and applies the rules of logical inference to determine the relations between combinations of variables and outcomes, which helps researchers validate hypotheses or discover new implications. However, existing QCA approaches or tools have limited capacities in handling multivalued explanatory and outcome variables, as well as in outputting compact results for human analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel QCA approach, which can deal with multivalued variables and support more complicated analysis. Our approach enables 1) multi-value reduction of candidate rules; and 2) effective counterfactual analysis associated with expert knowledge. We also implemented a new tool called fully functional multi-value QCA (fm-QCA). Through the evaluation, our tool outperforms existing state-of-the-art QCA tools in producing more compact analysis results as well as discovering more inferences.},

  abstract = {Nowadays critical peak load caused by residential customers has attracted utility companies and policymakers to pay more attention to residential demand response (RDR) programs. In typical RDR programs, residential customers react to the price or incentive-based signals, but the actions may naturally fall behind the flexible market situations. For those residential customers equipped with smart meters, they may contribute more DR loads if they can participate in DR events in a proactive way. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive market framework in which residential customers can provide proactive RDR actions in a day-ahead market (DAM). We model and evaluate the interactions between generation companies (GenCos), retailers, residential customers, and the independent system operator (ISO) via an agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) approach. The simulation framework contains two main procedures\textemdash the bottom-up modeling procedure and the reinforcement learning (RL) procedure. The bottom-up modeling procedure models the residential load profiles separately by household types to capture the RDR potential difference in advance so that residential customers may provide automatic DR actions rationally. Retailers and GenCos optimize their bidding strategies via the RL procedure. The modified optimization approach in this procedure can prevent the training results from falling into local optimum solutions. The ISO clears the DAM to maximize social welfare via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Based on realistic residential data in China, the proposed models and methods are verified and compared in a large multi-scenario test case with 30,000 residential households. Results show that proactive RDR programs and interactions among the market entities may yield significant benefits for both the supply and demand sides. The models and methods in this paper may be used by utility companies, electricity retailers, market operators, and policymakers to evaluate the consequences of the proactive RDR and the interactions among multi-entities.},

Some results point to a strong impact of social movements, while others conclude that they do not possess any observable leverage on public policies. These mixed results may be linked to utilization of different methodological approaches. However, few studies have considered the possibility that movements may in fact prevent policy change. In this study, we argue that for high-profile policies such as nuclear energy, a low-key social mobilization is in some instances necessary for the occurrence of major policy changes. We further hypothesize that highly mobilized social movements may dampen the chance of major policy changes instead of promoting them. We briefly present the general model and the data before proceeding to the bounded exploratory analysis. This analysis raises questions about the role played by antinuclear movements in their quest for a major policy change. A theoretical explanation is then presented in an attempt to contribute to the clarification of the movement-policy debate.},

Specifically, I estimate the effect of demand- and supply-side quantitative allocation policies on the price elasticity of housing supply and the home price volatility across municipalities in China. At the transaction level, I use Chinese land supply data to examine the substitution of land use types, and present evidence on politically driven land supply decisions that favor industrial land use and specific industries to increase local officials' promotion probabilities. For the US mortgage market, I leverage a unique dataset from Freddie Mac's national mortgage lender survey to examine the effect of quantitative easing on mortgage-backed securities pricing and primary mortgage rates. I find that large-scale purchases of mortgage-backed securities by the Federal Reserve is associated with substantial declines in mortgage rates across the country, but local economic and housing conditions are also important contributing factors to cross-sectional dispersion in mortgage rates. The combined results of these essays reveal policy decisions can have significant impact on housing market outcomes and provide directions for future research.},

The simulation experiments reveal good small sample performances. In the presence of serial correlation, either the group mean or the Fisher tests based on individual KPSS tests with l2 and LMC tests with p = 1 are recommended for use in empirical work due to their good small sample performances.},

Our results first show that a smaller government sector is required to transform technological knowledge into innovative nascent entrepreneurship. In addition, we found that a larger government sector and more regulation of credit, labor, and business increase the transformation of scientific knowledge into innovative nascent entrepreneurship.

However, the available empirical evidence for the United States shows that, starting in 1985, the propensity to save out of income for the household sector has decreased steadily. Starting in 1981, the share of income accruing to the richest 5 percent of the population increased steadily, with wide fluctuations related to capital gains on equities and, more recently, in the housing market.

The model will be used from a theoretical perspective to analyze the dynamics of markets along a steady growth path.]},

Most contributions simply try to feed national accounting data into a theoretical model inspired by Wynne Godley and Marc Lavoie (2007), albeit with different degrees of complexity. In this paper we argue instead that the structure of an empirical SFC model should start from a careful analysis of the specificities of a country's sectoral balance sheets and flow of funds data, given the relevant research question to be addressed. We illustrate our arguments with examples for Greece, Italy, and Ecuador. We also provide some suggestions on how to consistently use the financial and nonfinancial accounts of institutional sectors, showing the link between SFC accounting structures and national accounting rules.},

  abstract = {Keynesian models of household behavior suggest that a shift in the distribution of income toward profits\textemdash or toward rentiers\textemdash should imply an increase in the propensity to save out of income for the population as a whole. However, the available empirical evidence for the United States shows that, starting in 1985, the propensity to save out of income for the household sector has decreased steadily. Starting in 1981, the share of income accruing to the richest 5 percent of the population increased steadily, with wide fluctuations related to capital gains on equities and, more recently, in the housing market. The aim of this paper is to lay down a growth model, grounded in the Post Keynesian stock-flow-consistent approach of Godley and Lavoie, to analyze the links between consumption and saving behavior of two classes of households\textemdash financial markets and the housing market. The model will be used from a theoretical perspective to analyze the dynamics of markets along a steady growth path.},

  abstract = {The housing market has usually been analyzed in partial equilibrium models, or adopting a spatial/geographical approach. The aim of this paper is to propose a model for the housing sector in the context of a macroeconomic model for the whole economy, with all major relationships between real and financial markets properly accounted for, and a strong tie with national accounts. The general model is developed in the tradition of dynamic stock-flow consistent models (see for example Godley and Lavoie, 2007). We begin by presenting a general setting for a dynamic model, consistent with the Social Accounting Matrix aprroach to national accounts. We analyze some key variables related to the evolution of the U.S. housing market. Finally, after presenting the key features of the model, we simulate it to analyze its properties and its ability to reproduce some key stylized facts on the recent evolution of the U.S. economy.},

The primary source of the financial crisis was the increase in mortgage defaults, caused by the burst of the housing bubble. Prior to the crisis, the policies for housing mortgages within commercial banks were more relaxed. In the United States, before the subprime crisis, house prices were rising, and the market boomed, with people readily getting loans from commercial banks, without having to provide adequate guarantees. Inadequate risk management of mortgages was a major factor in causing financial disaster.},

I construct a new country level dataset on retail and central bank interest rates and bank profitability for the near-universe of industrialized countries from 1870 to 2015 and analyse the short- and medium-term effects of policy rate changes on banking spreads and bank performance. An increase in the policy rate drives the spread between lending and deposit rates up. The effect is mainly driven by a widening of the deposit-to-market spread, while the lending-to-market spread remains stable. On average, bank profitability falls after a policy rate hike \textendash{} but the effect is highly state dependent. It is increasing in the share of mortgage credit in the economy and decreasing in the share of deposit finance in bank liabilities. This holds both in the long-run cross-country data and across individual banks in the United States.},
