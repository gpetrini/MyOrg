  abstract = {The central role of the housing market in the recent recession raised a series of questions about similar episodes throughout economic history. Were the underlying causes of housing and mortgage crises the same in earlier episodes? Has the onset and spread of crises changed over time? How have previous policy interventions either damaged or improved long-run market performance and stability? This volume begins to answer these questions, providing a much-needed context for understanding recent events by examining how historical housing and mortgage markets worked\textemdash and how they sometimes failed. Renowned economic historians Eugene N. White, Kenneth Snowden, and Price Fishback survey the foundational research on housing crises, comparing that of the 1930s to that of the early 2000s in order to authoritatively identify what contributed to each crisis. Later chapters explore notable historical experiences with mortgage securitization and the role that federal policy played in the surge in home ownership between 1940 and 1960. By providing a broad historical overview of housing and mortgage markets, the volume offers valuable new insights to inform future policy debates.},

Based on a range of econometric analyses, it also investigates whether these housing-related policies achieve their objectives in an efficient and equitable way and whether there are any side effects on other aspects of housing markets or on the wider economy. One main finding is that badly-designed policies can have substantial negative effects on the economy, for instance by increasing the level and volatility of real house prices and preventing people from moving easily to follow employment opportunities. The paper makes some recommendations for the design of efficient and equitable housing policies that can improve the functioning of housing markets and contribute to macroeconomic stability and growth.},

Direct and indirect government intervention in the housing market through spatial planning and land policy, regulation and supervision of housing associations, rent policy and financial guarantees, generous mortgage interest deductibility and other explicit or implicit subsidies have led progressively to entrenched structural problems, which have negative consequences for the economy as a whole. Given the relatively rigid supply, price developments have been determined in particular by fiscal incentives and demand factors, under which innovations in mortgage financing have played a particularly important role, so that, compared to other euro area members, the Netherlands has relatively high levels of leveraged housing wealth. We conclude with possible reforms that would increase the efficiency of the Dutch housing market by addressing distortions in a gradual fashion while still achieving social policy objectives.},

A counterclockwise cycle in a two-dimensional phase diagram for capacity utilization and the wage share is based on long-run profit-led demand and a profit squeeze at high activity levels, consistent with Domar. Harrod-style investment and short-run wage-led demand generate counterfactual clockwise cycles. Financial dynamics involving the equity valuation ratio are considered. Both the ratio and equity price inflation demonstrate positive own-feedback. The ratio can be stabilized cyclically by capital stock growth and/or rising household net worth or debt. Debt accumulation persists (or `overshoots') after equity price inflation switches to a negative rate. A Minsky-style model with Harrodian investment can be stabilized by accumulation of business debt.},

  abstract = {Ethical attitudes and behaviour are complex. This complexity extends to the influencers operating at different levels both outside and within the organisation, and in different combinations for different individuals. There is hence a growing need to understand the proximal and distal influencers of ethical attitudes, and how these operate in concert at the individual, organisational, and societal levels. Few studies have attempted to combine these main research streams and systematically examine their combined impact. The minority of studies that have taken a combined approach have often done so using conventional statistical and analytical techniques which imply linearity between variables\textemdash a situation that rarely exists in business settings and is likely to lead to simplistic or even erroneous conclusions. Applying a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis approach, this paper reports on the mutual and simultaneous influence of individual demographic factors (gender, education), as well as proximal and distal factors stemming from within and outside the work environment (e.g. treatment by one's supervisor, country-level indicators of corruption perceptions) to understand individuals' ethical views within the workplace (n = 525). The multiple configurations that emerged reveal the complex nature of influencers of ethical attitudes, and reinforce the view that ``one size does not fit all''. We discuss these implications together with managerial recommendations and future research directions.},

Housing is a central aspect of financialization. The financialization of mortgage markets demands that not just homes but also homeowners become viewed as financially exploitable. It is exemplified by the securitization of mortgage loans, but also by the use of credit scoring and risk-based pricing. In the past century, mortgage markets were transformed from being a `facilitating market' for homeowners in need of credit to one increasingly facilitating global investment. Since mortgage markets are both local consumer markets and global investment markets, the dynamics of financialization and globalization directly relate homeowners to global investors thereby increasing the volatility in mortgage markets, as the current crisis shows all too well.},

We survey the existing evidence, which suggests that inflated house-price expectations across the economy played a central role in driving both the demand for and the supply of mortgage credit before the crisis. The great misnomer of the 2008 crisis is that it was not a subprime crisis but rather a middle-class crisis. Inflated house-price expectations led households across all income groups, especially the middle class, to increase their demand for housing and mortgage leverage. Similarly, banks lent against increasing collateral values and underestimated the risk of defaults. We highlight how these emerging facts have essential implications for policy.},

  abstract = {We use duration analysis to assess the impact of securitization, mortgage sector liberalization and government involvement in housing finance on the length of housing booms, busts and normal times in a panel of 20 OECD countries over the period 1970Q1-2015Q4. Our results reveal that a move towards a more liberalized mortgage sector is associated with longer housing booms, while an increase in securitization is linked with shorter housing busts. They also show that the length of housing booms and busts is particularly sensitive to housing finance characteristics, but that does not seem to be the case for normal times. Additionally, government support measures do not necessarily cushion against housing busts. A careful assessment of their distributional impact, as well as their effect on the trade-off between liquidity and guarantee/loan provision, is also required to prevent (longer) housing booms. All in all, housing finance regulation may prove especially relevant to shield against the damaging effects of housing busts and the financial stability risks associated with housing booms. Monetary policy can also be an important complement to macro-prudential policies. Finally, government participation in housing finance should be designed in a way that avoids an undesirable amplification of house price fluctuations.},

Using data for 20 industrial countries over the period 1970Q1\textendash 2012Q2 and a discrete-time Weibull duration model, we find that the likelihood of the end of a housing boom or a housing bust increases over time. Additionally, we show that the different phases of the housing market cycle are strongly dependent on the economic activity, but credit market conditions are particularly important in the case of housing booms. The empirical findings also indicate that although housing booms have similar lengths in European and non-European countries, housing busts are typically shorter in European countries. The use of a more flexible specification for the hazard function that is based on cubic splines suggests that it evolves in a nonlinear way. From a policy perspective, our study can be useful for predicting the timing and the length of housing boom\textendash bust cycles. Moreover, it highlights the importance of monetary policy by influencing lending rates and affecting the likelihood of occurrence of housing booms.},

This is done using the methodology of Principal Component Analysis, which can relate the information from different countries to its common sources. We also test for a structural change in the premium risk series in 2003, by means of structural break tests. We find that push factors do play the predominant role in explaining country risk changes of our selected peripherical countries and that there was indeed a substantial general reduction in country risk premia after 2003, confirming that the external constraints of the periphery were significantly loosened by more favorable conditions in the international economy in the more recent period. The results are in line both with the view that cycles in peripherical economies are broadly subordinated to global financial cycles, in but also that such external conditions substantially improved compared to the 1990s.},

  abstract = {A broadly accepted view contends that the 2007-09 financial crisis in the U.S. was caused by an expansion in the supply of credit to subprime borrowers during the 2001- 2006 credit boom, leading to the spike in defaults and foreclosures that sparked the crisis. We use a large administrative panel of credit file data to examine the evolution of household debt and defaults between 1999 and 2013. Our findings suggest an alternative narrative that challenges the large role of subprime credit in the crisis. We show that credit growth between 2001 and 2007 was concentrated in the prime segment, and debt to high risk borrowers was virtually constant for all debt categories during this period. The rise in mortgage defaults during the crisis was concentrated in the middle of the credit score distribution, and mostly attributable to real estate investors. We argue that previous analyses confounded life cycle debt demand of borrowers who were young at the start of the boom with an expansion in credit supply over that period.},

These include differences in: (i) the underlying components \textendash{} financial asset prices and capital flows for the global financial cycle (GFCy) versus credit and property prices for the domestic financial cycle (DFC); (ii) their empirical properties \textendash{} the GFCy has a shorter duration and is primarily linked with traditional business cycles, while the DFC has a longer duration and is predominantly linked with medium-term business cycles; and (iii) the policy focus \textendash{} ``dilemma versus trilemma'' for the GFCy, ``lean versus clean'' for the DFC. Despite these differences, the two cycles tend to come together around crises. Finally, we show that traditional GFCy measures mainly reflect developments in advanced economies and that a simple alternative measure is much more relevant for emerging market economies.},

Firstly, an unemployment benefits system organizes the distribution of the wage bill between employed and unemployed workers, the latter receiving an amount of money corresponding to the subsistence level. Secondly, only individuals with an income above the subsistence level build savings. The combination of these two hypotheses gives rise to an autonomous consumption expenditure whose rate of growth is given by the demographic rate of growth. As a consequence, the rate of capital accumulation spontaneously converges towards the demographic rate of growth (supermultiplier effect), a dynamics that gives a solution to one of the two Harrodian instability problems. The third hypothesis corresponds to the entrepreneurs' attempts to adjust investment in order to restore the normal rate of capacity utilization. Whereas such assumption usually generates knife-edge instability, we show here that this instability can be eliminated by the stabilizing properties of the supermultiplier. Moreover, the attempts to adjust investment enable to restore the normal rate of capacity utilization. In summary, the model offers a simple, simultaneous solution to the two Harrodian instability problems.},

Defaults on the principal are also taken into account. We then analyze the theoretical properties of the equilibriums (multiplier effect, stability conditions) resulting from the introduction of this framework in three types of models that differ in regard of who are the debtors and who are the creditors: workers can borrow from capitalists (essay 1) or from their peer (essay 2); capitalists can borrow from their peer (essay 3).},

  abstract = {Recent contributions to the comparative political economy literature claim that liberal market economies are vulnerable to asset booms and busts because of financial deregulation, shrinking welfare states and a political ideology emphasising financial self-sufficiency. This article examines the rapid expansion of mortgage lending in three coordinated market economies (CMEs): Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands. This expansion is puzzling given that all three countries are CMEs with generous welfare states. Yet the pattern of mortgage lending resembles the Anglo-Saxon or liberal market economies (LMEs) more than other CMEs. The article argues that mortgage bubbles in the small CMEs emerged as the unintended outcome of pairing neoliberal programmes to expand home ownership with collectivist housing institutions. This resulted in supply restrictions and rising property values which saddled households with extraordinarily high mortgage debts. In short, mortgage credit bubbles are not unique to Anglo-liberal welfare states and may have different origins.},

  abstract = {The global financial crisis has made it painfully clear that powerful psychological forces are imperiling the wealth of nations today. From blind faith in ever-rising housing prices to plummeting confidence in capital markets, "animal spirits" are driving financial events worldwide. In this book, acclaimed economists George Akerlof and Robert Shiller challenge the economic wisdom that got us into this mess, and put forward a bold new vision that will transform economics and restore prosperity. Akerlof and Shiller reassert the necessity of an active government role in economic policymaking by recovering the idea of animal spirits, a term John Maynard Keynes used to describe the gloom and despondence that led to the Great Depression and the changing psychology that accompanied recovery. Like Keynes, Akerlof and Shiller know that managing these animal spirits requires the steady hand of government--simply allowing markets to work won't do it. In rebuilding the case for a more robust, behaviorally informed Keynesianism, they detail the most pervasive effects of animal spirits in contemporary economic life--such as confidence, fear, bad faith, corruption, a concern for fairness, and the stories we tell ourselves about our economic fortunes--and show how Reaganomics, Thatcherism, and the rational expectations revolution failed to account for them.Animal Spirits offers a road map for reversing the financial misfortunes besetting us today. Read it and learn how leaders can channel animal spirits--the powerful forces of human psychology that are afoot in the world economy today.},

This article addresses this question by testing whether income inequality in OECD countries was related to events linked to the spread of communism\textemdash revolutions and  Soviet interventions\textemdash around the world. We argue that the threat of the spread of communism acted as an incentive for the elites and governments to keep economic inequality low. This article provides an empirical contribution to the recent literature on inequality, which highlights the  role of domestic institutions but ignores the role of the Cold War in redistributing income. We find a robust relationship between income inequality and the distance to communist events. The results, reinforced by cases studied, suggest that the spread of communism fostered income redistribution  deals between domestic elites and workers. Finally, we show that these effects were reinforced by strong unions and the presence of strong communist parties.},

  abstract = {Over the last decade, France and Spain have experienced property price and residential investment increases which were among the strongest and the lengthiest in the euro area. Although the quality of the underlying data limits the precision of the estimates, the present paper aims at analysing the fundamental factors behind these evolutions. The analysis presented here assesses whether the observed price dynamics may be attributed to a pure expectation bubble phenomenon or to the large changes in financial and demographic factors. This is done by means of a structural model of the demand and supply sides of the housing market with an error-correction process.When taking into account a standard set of macroeconomic variables, our estimates imply that residential property prices in France and Spain were approximately 20\% above the level explained by their fundamentals by the end of 2008. When demographic and financial factors such as the borrowing capacity are taken on board, the degree of overvaluation is drastically reduced. The adjustment path to equilibrium is slightly faster in France than in Spain, but both countries display significant downward rigidity in prices.},

  abstract = {The present paper assesses the impact of fiscal policy on residential investment in France. The analysis is conducted in the framework of a VECM, since this allows accounting for endogeneity between the variables. Our results imply that a long term relationship between investment and subsidies exists, making subsidies an adequate tool to influence residential investment and hence the business cycle. In addition, a disaggregated approach taking into account several different types of fiscalmeasures highlights that tax and interest rate subsidies are the most efficient fiscal tools for influencing residential investment.When accounting for financial factors by means of households' borrowing capacity, we find that the latter also impacts residential investment positively.Moreover, this alternative specification underlines the robustness of the above mentioned results, as it confirms subsidies as the most efficient measure to influence residential investment.},

We intend to spell out if income inequality was indeed reduced in the latest years. To accomplish that goal, the data for the analysis are issued from Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domic\'ilios (PNAD); also by means of income concentration index, which is divided into 5 features: labor income, pensions and public pensions, private pensions, rents, allowances, grants. In that regard, it covers that Brazilian income inequality jumped from 0.5826 (2002) to 0.5241 (2011). Among other things, from the results obtained is the important fact that by decreasing the parts the income inequality is reduced as a whole, regardless the composition effect is taken to be harmless. The labor income revealed to play an important role in reducing the Gini index by means of effect-concentration (55.83\%), and other incomes, which were responsible for reducing 20.72\%. The rents and pensions officers contributed 18.07\% for reducing the Gini index (G). Furthermore, the effects with respect the other incomes have undoubted influence on the reduction of Brazilian income inequality, especially in the Northeast.},

On the one hand, QCA algorithms often require large data sets in order to recover an accurate causal model, even if that model is relatively simple.

  abstract = {There has been a major shift within macroeconomic policy over the past three decades or so, in terms of the relative importance given to monetary policy and to fiscal policy. The former is gaining considerably in importance, while the latter is being so much downgraded that it is rarely discussed at least in academic circles these days. There are, of course, exceptions to this general statement. The onset of the `great recession' prompted governments to initiate fiscal measures that avoided another `great depression'. However, that was rather short-lived. It is now the case that a number of governments have resumed their hostility to fiscal policy as a stabilization instrument. In Arestis and Sawyer (1998, 2003a, 2004), we critically examined the significance of this shift in terms of monetary policy, which led us to question the effectiveness of interest rates now being used as the main instrument of monetary policy. In the same paper, but also in Arestis and Sawyer (2003b, 2006, 2010), we explored the role of fiscal policy, and argued that in the `new consensus in macroeconomics' within which macroeconomics in general and monetary policy in particular is generally discussed, there is barely any mention of fiscal policy.1},

The macroeconomic doctrine of the new consensus macroeconomics completely ignores bank credit. However, the Great Recession has highlighted the importance of bank credit. The purpose of this article is to revisit this important macroeconomic variable. Consequently, we propose to endogenize the volume of bank credit by paying special attention to those variables that are related to the real estate market, which can be considered as key to the evolution of bank credit. Our theoretical hypothesis is tested by means of a sample of nine economies of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) from 1970 to 2011. For this purpose, we apply the cointegration technique, which permits the modeling of the long-run equilibrium relationship and the short-run dynamics along with an error-correction term.},

In this context, one relationship, which still remains unclear, is the relationship between the housing and the labour markets. Some research has been undertaken to support the hypothesis that high rates of homeownership lead to high unemployment via increases in the reservation wage. However, further research is needed to address the possible implications of the institutional settings of the labour market in the dynamics of the housing market. The aim of this paper is to bring some light on the link between both markets. In particular, this contribution explains how the housing cycle could be ``amplified'' via a new channel, that is, economic precariousness, which is closely related to job insecurity.

The central bank should focus on financial stability; for fiscal policy in the short term and in the long term to address demand issues is very important. Interest rate policy should be such that the real rate of interest is in line with trend rate of growth in the economy. Fiscal and monetary policies, though, should be coordinated closely. Major central bank cooperation and intervention in the foreign exchange market is necessary to control the exchange rate. Regional and industrial policies to create the required capacity are important, along with incomes policies, to contain inflationary/deflationary pressures. Distribution of income and wealth is another important policy dimension in view of its importance in terms of the great recession.},

Financial liberalisation is an important key factor in this process. Rival explanations of the crisis are examined and rejected in favour of the extended Minskyan explanation.

  abstract = {The importance of the housing market and residential investment was highlighted by OECD (2000b), suggesting that `In the United States\ldots{} the contribution of real estate developments to the current economic expansion has been emphasised recently' (p. 169). In fact, it is argued that `Over the 1996\textendash 99 period, the growth of housing wealth in excess of income growth in the United States may have contributed 0.4 percentage point to the total drop of the household saving ratio of some 2.4 percentage points' (p. 179). The same OECD study concludes that `The link between house price developments and movements in aggregate demand suggests that monitoring developments in property markets can provide a useful input to the setting of economic policy' (OECD, 2000b, p. 181; see also, Greenspan, 1999).1 The boom of the housing market since the burst of the equity bubble has raised some concerns. Greenspan (2004c) emphasised the importance of `preventive actions' which `are required sooner rather than later' in order to `fend off possible future systemic difficulties, which we assess as likely if GSE expansion continues unabated' (p. 4).2 Especially so, since `the existence, or even the perception, of government backing undermines the effectiveness of market discipline' (p. 4). It is, therefore, suggested that `the GSE regulator must have authority similar to that of the banking regulator', but also `GSEs need to be limited in the issuance of GSE debt and in the purchase of assets, both mortgages and nonmortgages, that they hold' (p. 5).},

How much priority should be given to housing in view of the limited resources in less-developed countries? What are housing benefits in economic development vis-\`a-vis other economic investments? These questions have generated heated debates, both in the literature on development problems and in planning and practice in the 1950s and 1960s. This paper draws on the accumulated body of knowledge resulting from past experiences in research and policy to revisit the earlier debates, survey the main lines of argument and reassess the economic potential of housing. It then attempts to generate broad policy considerations. The main contention of this paper is that in light of past and present evidence, the housing sector needs to be given serious consideration in economic growth strategies.},

More financially distressed markets, as measured by bankruptcy rates and mortgage default double trigger, are more responsive to changes in FEAR Index than less distressed markets, and cold markets (markets with slow price appreciation) are more responsive than hot markets (markets with rapid price appreciation). We also examine these characteristics jointly and find that cold markets with financial distress are the most responsive to negative sentiment.

We study the impact of the exposure to real estate risk on stock demand. We find that, besides information and transaction costs and risk aversion, housing wealth is a key determinant of stockownership: households facing real estate risk tend to moderate their investments in stocks. This behaviour, called ''temperance'',may thus contribute to explain why people own so few stocks, in particular in France (stock participation puzzle).},

A further finding from the model is the need for banks to take into account time consistency when issuing credit in order to protect the financial stability of the system.},

  abstract = {We propose a theory of asset pricing based on heterogeneous agents who continually adapt their expectations to the market that these expectations aggregatively create. And we explore the implications of this theory computationally using our Santa Fe artificial stock market. Asset markets, we argue, have a recursive nature in that agents' expectations are formed on the basis of their anticipations of other agents' expectations, which precludes expectations being formed by deductive means. Instead traders continually hypothesize-continually explore-expectational models, buy or sell on the basis of those that perform best, and confirm or discard these according to their performance. Thus individual beliefs or expectations become endogenous to the market, and constantly compete within an ecology of others' beliefs or expectations. The ecology of beliefs co-evolves over time. Computer experiments with this endogenous-expectations market explain one of the more striking puzzles in finance: that market traders often believe in such concepts as technical trading, market psychology, and bandwagon effects, while academic theorists believe in market efficiency and a lack of speculative opportunities. Both views, we show, are correct, but within different regimes. Within a regime where investors explore alternative expectational models at a low rate, the market settles into the rational-expectations equilibrium of the efficient-market literature. Within a regime where the rate of exploration of alternative expectations is higher, the market self-organizes into a complex pattern. It acquires a rich psychology, technical trading emerges, temporary bubbles and crashes occur, and asset prices and trading volume show statistical features-in particular, GARCH behavior-characteristic of actual market data.},

This approach could be contrasted with the ``European'' model based on renting houses delivered mainly by the state. The 2007 crisis revealed that these differences bear far-reaching consequences not only for economic stability but also for aggregate demand. The aim of this paper is to analyze the macroeconomic differences between privately funded and state funded investment in the housing market. The following hypothesis is tested: public funding decreases debt burden in the economy and increases aggregate spending by households. The effects depend on the share of the rentier owned houses in the total housing stock. For the purpose of the research Post Keynesian stock-flow-consistent model is employed, aiming to extend the SFC model of the housing sector developed by G. Zezza in the article ``U.S. Growth, the Housing Market and the Distribution of Income'', Journal of Post Keynesian Economics, vol. 30 (2008), n. 3, pp. 379-405.},

  abstract = {This work aims to study the relationship between economic growth and income distribution. From the theoretical models of Cambridge, neo-Kaleckian and supermultiplier it is possible to establish two types of effects. The first, called level effect is predicted in all models, and establishes a direct relationship from the the wage share to the level of output which occurs via changes in the components of demand. The second, called growth effect occurs only in the neo-Kaleckian models, and is the causality relationship from the wage share to output growth. From this typology, we analyze the presence of these two effects in the empirical literature. It follows that there is no evidence of growth effect in this literature, but only level effect. Similarly, estimates indicate that, for the Brazilian economy the only statistically significant relationship found is a level effect, starting from the economic stability in 1994.},

  abstract = {Post-Keynesian growth models started incorporating household wealth dynamics as an important aspect of the relationship between growth and income distribution. Following these lines, this paper suggests a model in which household consumption decision is determined by a dynamic adjustment of wealth to a targeted level. We also suggest that household's targeted level of wealth takes into account the average income that they earn over a period of ten years. We then run an empirical estimation using microlevel data for wealth and wage of US households available in the PSID (Panel Study on Income Dynamics) Database. We find that the model yields statistically significant results for most income and age groups. We also observe that the target wealth to wage ratio is not constant across groups of income and age. This ratio tends to increase with income and is actually negative for the lowest income bracket. This empirical analysis then suggests that there is evidence for claiming that household debt-financed consumption is an autonomous component of demand and can be incorporated into a demand-led growth model to explain the trajectory of the US economy in the period under analysis.},

  abstract = {This paper examines how the liability side of Islamic banks is impacted by the risk in the macro economy. The paper first develops theoretical models for conventional and Islamic banks. For conventional banks, we argue that during periods of rising risk in the economy, investors with higher risk aversion prefer bank deposits as a haven compared to other asset classes, causing conventional banks to be flushed with excess liquidity, which is then disposed of in the form of risky loans. This may create asset price bubbles and a further increase in the overall risk of the economy. For Islamic banks, we build a theoretical model with a religious conscious customer base who demands products with religious compliance. The increased self-regulatory environment faced by Islamic banks on the backdrop of religious compliance helps reducing the influx of liquidity and conversion into risky loans during periods of heightened macroeconomic shocks. Using bank-level data from 20 Muslim-dominated countries for the period from 2000 to 2015, we test the propositions of our theoretical model. We find that the macroeconomic risk has a significant, positive impact on conventional bank deposits, while its impact on Islamic banks' deposits is either negative or significantly lower than their conventional counterparts.},

Our discussion emphasizes that export-led growth and consumption-led growth have different implications for distributive conflict.},

  abstract = {Why has household income in the National Household Survey (PNAD) grown so much faster than household consumption in Brazil's GDP from 2011 to 2012? To provide an answer to this question, we start from a visualization of the importance of the minimum wage in PNAD's income distribution and from a hypothesis that the underestimation of incomes in the PNAD surveys is concentrated in those families whose incomes do not follow the minimum wage. We then derive an equation to explain the difference between household income growth in the PNAD and household consumption growth in the national accounts as a function of the change in the minimum wage. Our empirical estimates of this equation suggest that the behavior of the minimum wage has been an important component in the explanation of differences in income growth between the PNAD and the GDP accounts.},

There is a large variation across both dimensions of mortgage market development, across countries, but also -- in terms of depth -- within countries. Mortgage markets seem to develop only at relatively high levels of gross domestic product per capita. Policies associated with financial system development are also associated with mortgage market development, including price stability and the efficiency of contractual and information frameworks. The development of the insurance sector and the stock market, sources of long-term funding, is strongly associated with mortgage market development, while government subsidies and support are not. A benchmarking exercise compares the actual values of mortgage market development to values predicted by structural country factors and shows a large variation across countries and over time in the gap between predicted and actual values, related to specific policies but also mortgage boom and bust cycles.},

  abstract = {In contrast to much of the political economy literature, this article explores acts of refusal that obstruct attempts to impose austerity measures on advanced industrial democracies. It thereby complements a literature that has thus far focused far more upon the (apparently unobstructed) imposition of austerity. In doing so, it uses two typically `low-resistance' countries \textendash{} Japan and the UK \textendash as least-likely cases and finds that austerity is rarely uncontested. Using fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis, it highlights the `causal recipes' sufficient for both (1) anti-austerity activity to have a significant impact on austerity proposals and (2) the smooth (unobstructed) imposition of austerity. The politics of austerity is shown to be better understood as an iterative interaction between proposals for austerity and the acts of refusal they encounter. These obstacles to austerity appear more straightforward to activate effectively in Japan's coordinated model of capitalism, whilst the UK's liberal market economy tends to generate more innovative forms of dissent that (if they are sufficiently militant) provide an alternative route towards the obstruction of austerity.},

The study includes economic growth, short-term interest rate, and population as additional covariates. Empirical results show that a positive shock to EPU leads to decrease in housing prices while the EPU shows only a weak response to housing price shocks. The results imply that EPU has robust predictive power for the housing market, implying the need for evaluating the associated risks. The panel Granger causality tests indicate strong and robust Granger causality from the EPU to housing prices, but not vice versa. The causal links also indicate that the effect of the EPU on is direct rather than indirect through other variables. Based on these outcomes, policy recommendations are made for real estate agents, portfolio managers, and policy makers.},

For the sake of comparison, analysing three developed economies reveals the diversification in the response of consumption to long-run output shocks. Canadian residents appear to be more sensitive to permanent domestic output shocks while Australian's consumption pattern remains unchanged.},

While there is a vast literature on housing models using two-dimensional panel data, there are few papers using multi-dimensional panels. This chapter focuses on housing models, residential mobility and location choice models derived from discrete choice theory, utilizing multi-dimensional panels. Examples include nested or hierarchical error components models, where a house is located in a street, within a block, within a city, within a county, etc. This chapter introduces some basic concepts of utility functions and discrete choice models used for hedonic functions, and residential mobility and location choices. Then it surveys some significant papers on multi-dimensional models of residential mobility and location choice. The paper concludes by surveying a few papers on dynamic housing models. It shows that both spatial and temporal dimensions in dynamic systems should be included for hedonic housing models and discrete models of residential location in a multi-dimensional framework. However, the inclusion of these multiple dimensions greatly complicates the specification and modeling of such systems.},

  abstract = {Recognising the rapid increase in housing prices and the presence of socio-economic and demographic disparities that often characterise a metropolitan city, we adopted a sub-city approach and deployed an array of methods to detect bubbles in the different regions of Greater Sydney \textendash{} western, inner-west, southern, eastern and northern \textendash{} over 1991 to 2016, using Westerlund error correction-based panel cointegration, backward supremum augmented Dickey\textendash Fuller (BSADF) procedure, and dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) tests. Our cointegration results show no evidence of cointegration between real house price and rent in the western region. However, there is strong evidence of cointegration in the eastern and northern regions. This confirms the existence of housing submarkets in Greater Sydney, and an indication of housing price bubbles in Western Sydney. Further, the formal BSADF bubble tests reveal strong evidence of explosive price bubbles in Western Sydney, while there is no comparable evidence for the other regions of Sydney, which further highlights the importance of submarket analysis. Importantly, the DOLS results suggest that housing investment plays a major role in the build-up of housing bubbles in Western Sydney, supporting Shiller's Psychological Theory of bubbles which posits that bubbles occur via the speculative behaviour of investors. The implications of the findings are also discussed.},

  author = {Barba, Aldo and Pivetti, Massimo},
  year = {2009},
  abstract = {The article analyses the rise in household indebtedness from the point of view of its causes and long-run macroeconomic implications. The analysis is focussed on the US case. Differently from life-cycle interpretations of the phenomenon, and from interpretations in terms of erratic deviations of current income flows from their long-run trend, the rising household debt is viewed as the outcome of persistent changes in income distribution and growing income inequalities. Through household debt, low wages appear to have been brought to coexist with relatively high levels of aggregate demand, thus providing the solution to the contradiction between the necessity of high and rising consumption levels, for the growth of the system's actual output, and a framework of antagonistic conditions of distribution which keeps within limits the real income of the vast majority of society. The question of the long-run sustainability of this substitution of loans for wages is finally discussed. Reprinted by permission of Oxford University Press},

As in Goodwin's cyclical growth model, b can be interpreted as a Lotka-Volterra predator variable and u as prey. In a phase diagram, dynamics around the u=0 schedule respond to effective demand that econometric estimation (1948-2002) shows to be profit-led. Distributive dynamics around the b=0 curve demonstrate a long-term profit squeeze. Across cycles, the real wage and labor productivity grow at 0.57 per cent per quarter, holding the labor share broadly stable. Modeling the cycle in the (u, b) plane provides a parsimonious description of demand and distributive dynamics, consistent with the macroeconomics embedded in the work of Kalecki, Steindl, Goodwin and many subsequent authors.},

  abstract = {Was there really a debt-fuelled `liberal growth model' that preceded the 2008 financial crisis? The accepted narrative about the pre-crisis boom is that some liberal countries relied on domestic consumption to fuel economic growth, and on household debt to fuel this consumption. In this, they contrasted with coordinated economies. While eventually unsustainable, the growth strategy was politically necessary to maintain middle-class living standards in the context of increasing income inequality. In this article, I take these contentions to the data. Economic evidence from 1995\textendash 2007 and political data from the Comparative Manifesto Project Database undermine this received wisdom: while household debt increased in the liberal countries, it does not differentiate this particular growth model. Further, there is no evidence that politicians in liberal countries advocate different economic policies, including those concerning borrowing, to claim credit and stay in power. Differences in the importance of finance between countries, however, suggest a more elite-driven divergence.},

The long\textendash run semi\textendash elasticity for interest rates are 2.1 and 0.9 for Sweden and the UK.

Granger causality tests indicate that income Granger causes house prices for Sweden, while for the UK there is also feedback from house prices to income. House prices Granger cause financial wealth for Sweden, while for the UK it is vice\textendash versa. House prices cause household debt for Sweden, while for the UK there is a feedback from debt. Interest rates Granger cause house prices for the UK and Sweden. In both countries Tobin's q Granger cause housing investment.

But today, in a cruel twist, many Americans now regard their homes as a source of worry and dashed expectations. How did everything go haywire? And what can we do about it now? In The Rise and Fall of the U.S. Mortgage and Credit Markets, renowned finance expert James Barth offers a comprehensive examination of the mortgage meltdown. Together with a team of economists at the Milken Institute, he explores the shock waves that have rippled through the entire financial sector and the real economy. Deploying an incredibly detailed and extensive set of data, the book offers in-depth analysis of the mortgage meltdown and the resulting worldwide financial crisis. This authoritative volume explores what went wrong in every critical area, including securitization, loan origination practices, regulation and supervision, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, leverage and accounting practices, and of course, the rating agencies. The authors explain the steps the government has taken to address the crisis thus far, arguing that we have yet to address the larger issues.  Offers a comprehensive examination of the mortgage market meltdown and its reverberations throughout the financial sector and the real economy Explores several important issues that policymakers must address in any future reshaping of financial market regulations Addresses how we can begin to move forward and prevent similar crises from shaking the foundations of our financial system  The Rise and Fall of the U.S. Mortgage and Credit Markets analyzes the factors that should drive reform and explores the issues that policymakers must confront in any future reshaping of financial market regulations.},

We exploit a new household-level dataset that covers the joint distributions of debt, income, and wealth in the United States over the past seven decades. The data show that increased borrowing by middle-class families with low income growth played a central role in rising indebtedness. Debt-to-income ratios have risen most dramatically for households between the 50th and 90th percentiles of the income distribution. While their income growth was low, middle-class families borrowed against the sizable housing wealth gains from rising home prices. Home equity borrowing accounts for about half of the increase in U.S. household debt between the 1970s and 2007. The resulting debt increase made balance sheets more sensitive to income and house price fluctuations and turned the American middle class into the epicenter of growing financial fragility.},

  abstract = {In this paper we focus on Italian aggregate quarterly time series covering the 1980-2008 sample period and test the presence and size of wealth effects on consumption, taking separately account of financial assets and residential property on the basis of new stock measures. We find sound evidence in favour of a cointegrating relation, in which both wealth components display the expected, positive effect on households` consumption. In particular, our results point to a lower marginal propensity to consume out of housing than out of non housing net worth, with a respective size laying in the range of 1.5-2 and 4-6 cents. Following the estimate of a vector error correction model, we discuss the role played by transitory and permanent shocks in driving changes in the variables we consider. We have found that both consumption and wealth respond almost exclusively to permanent shocks, which are the sole determinants of the common stochastic trend in our theoretical set-up. As a result, we are confident that our estimates of wealth coefficients in the cointegrating vector match very closely the true long run marginal propensity to consume for Italian households.},

  abstract = {Post Keynesian macrodynamic models make various assumptions about the normal rate of capacity utilization. Those rooted in the Classical and neo-Keynesian traditions assume the normal rate is fixed, whereas Kaleckian models treat it as a variable that is endogenous to the actual rate of capacity utilization. This paper contributes to the debate about the normal rate of capacity utilization by developing a model of strong or genuine hysteresis, in which firms make discrete decisions about the normal rate depending on the degree of uncertainty about demand conditions. An agent-based model based on empirical analysis of 25 sectors of the US economy is used to show that hysteresis can cause variation in the normal rate of capacity utilization within a subset of the range of observed variation in the actual capacity utilization rate. This suggests that the economy exhibits both constancy and (endogenous) variability in the normal rate of utilization over different ranges of variation in the actual rate. More broadly speaking, the genuine hysteresis model is shown to provide the basis for a synthesis of Post Keynesian macrodynamics that draws on both the Classical/neo-Keynesian and Kaleckian modeling traditions.},

A measure of the economic importance of this increase is that at the end of the sample period, the average firm can retire all debt obligations with its cash holdings. Cash ratios increase because firms' cash flows become riskier. In addition, firms change: They hold fewer inventories and receivables and are increasingly R\&D intensive. While the precautionary motive for cash holdings plays an important role in explaining the increase in cash ratios, we find no consistent evidence that agency conflicts contribute to the increase.},

  abstract = {To date, hundreds of researchers have employed the method of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) for the purpose of causal inference. In a recent series of simulation studies, however, several authors have questioned the correctness of QCA in this connection. Some prominent representatives of the method have replied in turn that simulations with artificial data are unsuited for assessing QCA. We take issue with either position in this impasse. On the one hand, we argue that data-driven evaluations of the correctness of a procedure of causal inference require artificial data. On the other hand, we prove all previous attempts in this direction to have been defective. For the first time in the literature on configurational comparative methods, we lay out a set of formal criteria for an adequate evaluation of QCA before implementing a battery of inverse-search trials to test how this method performs in different recovery contexts according to these criteria. While our results indicate that QCA is correct when generating the parsimonious solution type, they also demonstrate that the method is incorrect when generating the conservative and intermediate solution type. In consequence, researchers using QCA for causal inference, particularly in human-sensitive areas such as public health and medicine, should immediately discontinue employing the method's conservative and intermediate search strategies.},

We also provide an alternative estimator of the standard errors that is correct when the error structures show complications found in this type of model. Monte Carlo analysis shows that these "panel-corrected standard errors" perform well. The utility of our approach is demonstrated via a reanalysis of one "social democratic corporatist" model.},

Most of the literature on financialization is focused on the economies of the centre. This paper analyses the peculiarities of financialization in the periphery, which is characterized by a high degree of extraversion and/or by considerable socio-economic heterogeneity. The theory of regulation permits analysis of different forms of financialization and the social dynamics linked with them. In contrast to Keynesian approaches, the state, international organizations and social forces shaping norms and policies are an explicit part of the theory. This allows for looking at policy-making within the analysis. Such an analysis enables us to explain policy changes (or lack of them) that are crucial for the processes of financialization and de-financialization in the periphery.},

After a brief introduction to QCA, the specific type of causality handled by QCA is discussed. QCA is shown to offer improvements over Mill's methods by handling asymmetric and multiple-conjunctural causality in addition to counterfactual reasoning. It thereby allows the explicitly separate analysis of necessity and sufficiency, recognizing the relevance of causal packages as well as single causes and of multiple causal paths leading to the same outcome (equifinality). It is argued that QCA can generalize findings to a small, medium and large number of cases.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate whether changes in income distribution can explain current account developments in a sample of 20 countries for the period 1972\textendash 2007. We analyze the relationship between the personal and the functional income distribution in our sample, before disentangling their effects on the current account. A consistent finding is that rising (top-end) personal inequality leads to a decrease of the current account, controlling for standard current account determinants. By contrast, a fall in the share of wages in national income leads to an increase in the current account. We further analyze how different measures of income distribution affect the financial balances of the household, corporate and government sectors and discuss potential theoretical explanations of our findings. We conclude that changes in personal and functional income distribution have contributed considerably to the widening of current account balances, and hence to the instability of the international economic system, prior to the global financial crisis starting in 2007.},

We use our DSGE set-up to study the impact of variations in house price expectations upon macroeconomic dynamics and their implications for monetary and macroprudential policies. Model simulations show that an increase in expected future house prices leads to a decline in mortgage defaults and interest rates on loans, whereas it leads to an increase in house prices, household debt, bank leverage ratios and economic activity. Interestingly, a positive fundamental housing preference shock causes a rise in inflation, whilst a positive non-fundamental shock to house prices generates a decline in inflation. We demonstrate that even though monetary policy reacting to household credit growth improves the stability of the real economy, yet it jeopardizes price stability. Finally, we show that the effectiveness of monetary versus macroprudential policy depends on whether the economy is affected by non-fundamental or fundamental shocks.},

His definition is applied to two opposing theories in the history of monetary debates, and it is shown that the Chartalists (as opposed to the Metallists) developed a general theory of money that can be applied equally convincingly to the entire era of state money. This theory is then used to show that the state's power to make and enforce tax laws renders its money the most acceptable form of debt within what can be considered a `hierarchy' of monies. This leads to some important policy implications as well as a strengthening of the endogenous money position.},

We propose a consistent model based on microfoundations in which households decide on the sequence of buying and selling, i.e. whether to hold two or zero houses in the transition period. Data on individual sellers and buyers support the hypothesis that the propensity to hold two houses is pro-cyclical.},

This reform followed the failure of more than 2,000 depository institutions in the 1980s. Many failed because the incentive incompatibility of the structure of federal government-provided deposit insurance encouraged moral hazard behavior by banks and poor agent behavior by regulators. Insurance was put on a more incentive compatible basis, providing for a graduated series of sanctions mimicking market discipline that first may and then must be applied by the regulators on floundering banks.

  abstract = {In this paper Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) is used to explore the extent to which states have taken distinct causal paths to higher levels of earnings inequality within the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and during the early years of the 2007\textendash 09 recession. In these analyses special attention is paid to both the regional unfolding of the processes constituting economic restructuring and whether state institutional arrangements appear to mediate the impacts of inequality-increasing developments. Overall, these analyses suggest that industry and occupational shifts are critical to understanding state and regional experiences; state variation in changes in earnings inequality are, in large part, a story of the continuous playing out of economic restructuring in unique ways in different areas of the country. However, the subnational impact of the growth or decline of particular types of occupations on the earnings distribution is found to be highly contingent, depending on both the types of jobs gained or lost and the institutional and economic context in which those developments occur. It is suggested that the overall contribution of industry shifts to rising inequality may be underemphasized, in part, as a result of a reliance on analytical approaches that are ill-suited to capture the complicated and contingent nature of the impacts of processes such as deindustrialization. These analyses contribute to a growing body of work that employs a distinctly sociological approach in which earnings determination is viewed as multi-level phenomenon. Building on this insight, this paper suggests that changes in subnational levels of inequality may also be usefully conceptualized as an inherently combinatorial phenomenon.},

It then systematically tests a broad variety of hypotheses concerning the historical, social?structural, socio?economic, political and institutional determinants and performance characteristics of these system types. A macro?quantitative synopsis attempts to identify the most ?parsimonious? overall constellations of factors in this regard. This is supplemented by a macro?qualitative analysis of major ?conjunctural? conditions identifying the main groups of cases and their determining factors in a ?contradiction?free? manner. The conclusions point to the decisive importance of ?governance? aspects in the future.},

(Autorenreferat)'There are some new attempts to bridge the divide between quantitative and qualitative methods in the social sciences (see also Berg-Schlosser \& Quenter 1996). This paper explicitly illustrates and tests some of these methods like regression, cluster, or discriminant analysis, on the one hand, and more recent case- and diversity-oriented methods like QCA, Multi-Value QCA (MVQCA), and Fuzzy-Set QCA (fs/ QCA) on the other. This is done by using data to test Lipset's theory of socio-economic 'requisites' of democracy on the basis of 18 cases in Europe in the interwar period. In this way, the specific strengths and weaknesses of the respective methods are demonstrated.' (author's abstract)},

This is at odds with a prominent theoretical view which, using the logic of the permanent income hypothesis, argues that consumption responses should be small. We show that, in contrast to this view, workhorse models of consumption with incomplete markets calibrated to rich cross-sectional micro facts actually predict large consumption responses, in line with the data. To explain this result, we show that consumption responses to permanent house price shocks can be approximated by a simple and robust rule-of-thumb formula: the marginal propensity to consume out of temporary income times the value of housing. In our model, consumption responses depend on a number of factors such as the level and distribution of debt, the size and history of house price shocks, and the level of credit supply. Each of these effects is naturally explained with our simple formula.},

It has also generated a cottage industry of applied research and strong policy statements. This paper discusses the implications, in particular for developing and transition countries, from this literature. Our general conclusion is that its focus on the plight of small investors is too narrow when applied to these countries. We argue that this group is unlikely to play an important role in most developing and transition countries. External investors may still be crucial, particularly in transition countries, but they are more likely to come in as strategic investors or creditors. The paper also proposes a broader paradigm including other stakeholders and mechanisms of governance in order to better understand the problems facing these countries and generate policy implications that compensate for the weaknesses of capital markets.},

We also distinguish between growth effects of stocks and flows of credit. We find positive growth effects for credit flows to nonfinancial business but not for mortgage and other asset market credit flows. By accounting for the composition of credit stocks and for the effect of credit flows, we explain the insignificant or negative growth effects of financial development in recent times. What was true in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s when the field of empirical credit-growth studies blossomed, is no longer true in the 1990s and 2000s. New bank lending is not primarily to nonfinancial business and financial development may no longer be good for growth. These trends predate the 2008 crisis. They prompt a rethink of the role of banks in the process of economic growth. (JEL E44, O16, O40, C33)},

  abstract = {Using the Keynesian theory of effective demand, this paper demonstrates how particular models, such as that of "cooperative capitalism" enunciated by the left Keynesian social democrats, the Marxian model of "profit squeeze" emphasizing distributive conflict, and even the conservative model relying on "supply side" stimulus, fit in as particular variants of a more general theoretical scheme through a reconstruction of the familiar IS schedule. The argument is weaved around the theme of the relations between unemployment and real wage in the context of both a closed and an open economy to explain the common macroeconomic basis of contesting ideologies.

  abstract = {Thirlwall's law, given by the ratio of the rate of growth of exports to the income elasticity of imports is a key result of balance-of-payments-constrained long-run growth models with balanced trade. Some authors have extended the analysis to incorporate long-run net capital flows. We provide a critical evaluation of these efforts and propose an alternative approach to deal with long-run external debt sustainability, based on two key features. First, we treat the external debt-to-exports ratio as the relevant indicator for the analysis of external debt sustainability. Second, we include an external credit constraint in the form of a maximum acceptable level of this ratio. The main results that emerge are that sustainable long-run capital flows can positively affect the long-run level of output, but not the rate of growth compatible with the balance-of-payments constraint, as exports must ultimately tend to grow at the same rate as imports. Therefore, Thirlwall's law still holds.},

We estimate a 27 percent rise in extraction in response to a 100 basis point rate decline, and that house price growth amplifies this relationship. Differential responses to interest rates and home price appreciation by borrower age and credit score provide new evidence of financial frictions. Finally, equity extractions are associated with higher default risk, consistent with the use of borrowed funds for consumption or illiquid investment.},

(2005 Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 56, 489\textendash 512). The CATS model has been extensively used to replicate a large number of scaling types stylized facts with a remarkable degree of precision. For such purposes, the simulation of the model has been performed entering ad hoc parameter values and using the same initial set up for all the agents involved in the experiments. Nowadays alternative robust and reliable validation techniques for determining whether the simulation model is an acceptable representation of the real system are available. Moreover many distributional and goodness-of-fit tests have been developed while several graphical tools have been proposed to give the researcher a quick comprehension of actual and simulated data. This paper discusses some validation experiments performed with the modified CATS model. In particular starting from a sample of Italian firms included in the CEBI database, we perform several ex-post validation experiments over the simulation period 1982\textendash 2000. In the experiments, the model parameters have been estimated using actual data and the initial set up consists of a sample of agents in 1982. The CATS model is then simulated over the period 1982\textendash 2000. Using alternative validation techniques, the simulations' results are ex-post validated with respect to the actual data. The results are promising in that they show the good capabilities of the CATS model in reproducing the observed reality. Finally we have performed a first calibration experiment via indirect inference, in order to ameliorate our estimates. Even in this case, the results are interesting.},

The article stresses the relevance of putting into action two ``turbo-chargers'' of these three engines of investment; namely technological innovation and the recuperation of traditional productive chains.

In the literature, production systems containing only basics are more in vogue. In an article on Sraffa's book, Professor Newman* proposes to 'abandon' nonbasics, by omitting them from the system, in the interest of analytical simplicity; particularly, to avoid the possibility of negative prices which a system containing nonbasics may give rise to (see Appendix below). However the existence of nonbasics is an objective property of a system and while nonbasics may be ignored in a first approximation they will have ultimately to be taken into account.

  abstract = {I n his "Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities" Piero Sraffa introduces a classification of commodities into 'basics' and 'nonbasics' : A commodity is called 'basic' to the system of production if it enters, directly or indirectly, into every other commodity in the system 5 a commodity which does not do so is called ' nonbasic \textbackslash{} Opinions have diverged as to the role and significance of this distinction. In the literature, production systems containing only basics are more in vogue. In an article on Sraffa's book, Professor Newman* proposes to 'abandon' nonbasics, by omitting them from the system, in the interest of analytical simplicity; particularly, to avoid the possibility of negative prices which a system containing nonbasics may give rise to (see Appendix below). However the existence of nonbasics is an objective property of a system and while nonbasics may be ignored in a first approximation they will have ultimately to be taken into account. Other writers, while considering nonbasics, have adopted, instead of this distinction between commodities,},

We interpret the Covid-19 shock as a shock that reduces utility stemming from ``social'' goods in a two-sector economy with incomplete markets. We compare the advantages of lump-sum transfers versus a credit policy. For the same path of government debt, transfers are preferable when debt limits are tight, whereas credit policy is preferable when they are slack. A credit policy has the advantage of targeting fiscal resources toward agents that matter most for stabilizing demand. We illustrate this result with a calibrated model. We discuss various shortcomings and possible extensions to the model.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we argue that the complexion of housing finance systems in OECD countries, both now and historically, has a significant bearing on a number of core housing-related indicators, including housing form, tenure composition, and urban development. Existing literature in the fields of housing studies and comparative political economy, however, has often neglected the historical dynamics of housing finance, while contemporaneously, financial historians have focused almost exclusively on company and not mortgage finance. We identify four different "ideal types" of housing finance systems that developed in mature capitalist economies when organized housing finance institutions began to emerge throughout the long nineteenth century: informal person-to-person lending and state lending as solutions outside specialized banking circuits, and deposit-based and bond-based institutions as banking solutions. We adapt Alexander Gerschenkron's theory of economic backwardness in order to explain the temporal-spatial emergence of these distinct types. We draw a path-dependent conclusion, noting that the more countries developed bond-based mortgage banks in the nineteenth century, the more they tended towards multi-story building structure, low homeownership rates and lower securitization levels in the twentieth century. A collection of unique historical city and country data supports these findings.},

This paper reviews the theoretical arguments and examines the empirical evidence, constructing and using a new US time series of data on the q ratio from 1900 to 1988. We decompose q - - the ratio of the market value of corporate capital to its replacement cost - - into the product of two terms, reflecting "fundamentals" and "valuation", the ratio of market value to fundamentals. We then examine the relation of investment to each of the two, using a number of alternative proxies for fundamentals. We interpret our results as pointing, strongly but not overwhelmingly, to a larger role of "fundamentals" than of "valuation" in investment decisions.},

If the economy is relatively open to trade and price elasticities satisfy certain restrictions, the worsening of the trade balance more than outweighs the increase in workers' consumption, thus reducing the growth rate. The main theoretical innovation is a flexible markup pricing rule that allows changes in unit labor costs and exchange rates to affect profit margins. Implications for international relations and class conflict are discussed. Copyright 1989 by Oxford University Press.},

Long-run growth is usually portrayed as a supply-determined process. The contributions to this volume, however, are rooted in the theory of demand-led growth. In addition to general discussions of the role of demand in the long-run, the volume contains essays in the Kaldorian and Kaleckian traditions, and a section on the relationship between demand-led growth and structural change. The conclusion reached is that current neglect of the role of demand in analyses of long-run growth is unwarranted.},

We find that ECB monetary policy has affected both stock and house prices in the euro area since 2008. However, we show that monetary policy influences stock price imbalances but not house price imbalances. Exploring further the mechanism, we find that this response of stock price imbalances is driven by central bank information shocks, not by pure policy shocks.},

We use a Monte Carlo approach to investigate the performance of several different methods designed to reduce the bias of the estimated coefficients for the longer, narrower panels commonly found for macro data. We find that the bias of the least squares dummy variable approach can be significant, even when the time dimension of the panel is as large as 30. For panels with small time dimensions, we find a corrected least squares dummy variable estimator to be the best choice. However, as the time dimension of the panel increases, the computationally simpler Anderson-Hsiao estimator performs equally well. We apply our recommendations to a panel of countries to show that increases in income growth precede increases in savings rates and increases in savings rates precede declines in income growth.},

Using a unique intraday dataset, we show that US macroeconomic news releases have large and significant effects on global risky asset prices.

The responses of stock indexes co-move across countries and are large\textemdash often comparable in size to the response of the S\&P 500. Further, these effects are persistent. US macroeconomic news explain up to 22\% of the quarterly variation in foreign stock markets. The joint behavior of stock prices and long-term bond yields suggests that systematic monetary policy responses to news play a limited role for explaining the behavior of international stock markets. Instead, the evidence is consistent with a direct effect on investors' risk-taking capacity. Overall, our findings show that a byproduct of the United States' central position in the global financial system is that news about its business cycle have large effects on global financial conditions.},

On two other dimensions, the model's business cycle implications are actually improved. Its enhanced internal propagation allows it to account for the fact that there is positive persistence in output growth, and the model also provides a resolution to the 'excess sensitivity puzzle' for consumption and income. Key features of the model are habit persistence preferences, and a multisector technology with limited intersectoral mobility of factors of production.},

The third section examines whether yield spreads have reliably forecast real economic activity in the 11 countries, using several measures of real economic activity and alternative forecast horizons. The empirical results indicate the yield spread is a statistically and economically significant predictor of real economic activity in several industrial countries besides the United States. In addition, the yield spread forecasting model generally outperforms two alternative forecasting models in predicting future real GDP growth.},

These discussions took place in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis that is the consequence of the bust of an house price bubble that took place in the US and spread out to most developed countries. Crucial to the success of such policy is the ability of the macro-prudential authority to identify in due time such imbalances, generally featured by asset price boom-bust cycles. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of detecting house price booms according to alternative identification strategies and assess their robustness. In addition, we try to disentangle costless or low-cost from costly house price booms. Resorting both to a non-parametric approach and a discrete-choice (logit) model, we analyze the ability of a set of indicators to robustly explain costly house price booms. According to our results, real long term interest rates, total investment, real credit and real stock prices tend to increase the probability of a costly house price boom.},

While identifying financial imbalances ex ante can be difficult, this paper presents empirical evidence that it is not impossible. In particular, sustained rapid credit growth combined with large increases in asset prices appears to increase the probability of an episode of financial instability. The paper also argues that while low and stable inflation promotes financial stability, it also increases the likelihood that excess demand pressures show up first in credit aggregates and asset prices, rather than in goods and services prices. Accordingly, in some situations, a monetary response to credit and asset markets may be appropriate to preserve both financial and monetary stability.},

  abstract = {In analysing the performance of the international monetary and financial system (IMFS), too much attention has been paid to the current account and far too little to the capital account. This is true of both formal analytical models and historical narratives. This approach may be reasonable when financial markets are highly segmented. But it is badly inadequate when they are closely integrated, as they have been most of the time since at least the second half of the 19th century. Zeroing on the capital account shifts the focus from the goods markets to asset markets and balance sheets. Seen through this lens, the IMFS looks quite different. Its main weakness is its propensity to amplify financial surges and collapses that generate costly financial crises \textendash{} its ``excess financial elasticity''. And assessing the vulnerabilities it hides requires going beyond the residence/non-resident distinction that underpins the balance of payments to look at the consolidated balance sheets of the decision units that straddle national borders, be these banks or non-financial companies. We illustrate these points by revisiting two defining historical phases in which financial meltdowns figured prominently, the interwar years and the more recent Great Financial Crisis.},

  abstract = {This paper attempts a methodological appraisal of Luigi Pasinetti's recent contribution to the analysis of structural economic dynamics. After briefly reviewing the content of Pasinetti's volume, the author presents a general consideration on the method employed. The relationship between Pasinetti's approach to the analysis of economic growth and structural change on the one hand, and neoclassical theory, on the other, is then briefly considered. Finally, the model of a `pure labour' economy is assessed, and the procedure of abstraction to be used in investigating structural dynamics is discussed. In particular, it is argued that Pasinetti's method is based upon a realist approach, and that attention is focused upon general principles rather than empirical regularities derived from observation. In this connection, Smith's and Ricardo's treatments of a `pure labour' economy are considered, and it is argued that they are based upon alternative simplifying assumptions: exclusion of capital goods in Smith's case, uniform ratios of capital to labour in Ricardo's case. The author maintains that a Ricardian-type pure labour economy may enhance the plausibility of Pasinetti's approach to structural dynamics, and facilitate possible extensions.},

  abstract = {Monetary circuit theory is one of the most interesting attempts to formally describe the functioning of a monetary production economy as centered around the concept of flux-reflux of money. Endogenous money creation by commercial banks allows the circuit to open and firms to implement production processes. Financial markets ``passively'' close the circuit by intermediating savings via bond and equity issuance. Despite its natural focus on financial-real side links, the monetary circuit literature has paid relatively little attention to `financialization' and the way it has modified real-financial dynamics. In this paper, we analyze whether the flux-reflux perspective of the circuit may be fruitfully applied to the description of the linkages between the real economy and finance in a financialized economy. We propose two interconnected circuits, one for the real economy and one for the financial one. In this context, finance can still ensure a consistent closure of the whole system, thus directly allowing the functioning of the real economy. Newly developed inside-finance interactions, however, may indirectly influence real world dynamics by easing/restricting access to credit/financial markets and give rise to boom-and-bust cycles. Our aim is twofold: modeling modern financial worlds within a MC framework and understanding how financialization could have changed real-financial interactions.},

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to broaden purely real-side Post-Keynesian models and their traditional focus on shareholder-value orientation, the financialization of non-financial firms, and the profit-led vs. wage-led dichotomy. We rather put emphasis on the role of financial institutions and rentier-friendly environment in determining the predominance of specific growth and distribution regimes. First, we illustrate the macroeconomic rationale of shadow banking practices. We show how, before the 2007\textendash 08 crisis, securitization and shadow banking allowed for an increase in profitability for the whole financial sector, while apparently keeping leverage under control. Second, we define a variety of shadow-banking-led regimes in terms of economic activity, productive capital accumulation, and income distribution.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, complexity economics has emerged as a powerful approach to the understanding of the most relevant factors influencing economic development. The concept of economic complexity has been applied to the study of different economic issues such as economic growth, technological change and inequality. With this work we aim at extending the application of this concept to the study of the financial side of the economy, and, in particular, of the macroeconomic effects of rising financial complexity. In this paper, we present an agent-based model integrating an increasingly complex financial sector with a real side of the economy populated, among other sectors, by heterogeneous households. We test the systemic impact that the increasing complexity of both the financial system and the financial products it manufactures bear on economic growth, macroeconomic stability and inequality. We find mixed results with respect to the positive economic implications the existing literature ascribes to products complexity and deepening production capabilities. Despite higher financial complexity may lead to faster growth, our model suggests that this comes at the cost of heightened financial fragility, a more crisis-prone economic system, and increasing levels of income and wealth inequality. According to these findings, and consistently with pioneering insights from Minsky, we claim that rising complexity does not always entail positive consequences for the well-being of the economy. This is particularly true when it comes to financial innovations and financial complexity.},

A calibration of our model at the scale of the world economy enables us to simulate various planetary scenarios. Our findings are threefold: 1) the +2 \textdegree C target is already out of reach, absent negative emissions; 2) the longterm (resp. short-term) results of climate change on economic fundamentals may lead to severe economic consequences without the implementation (resp. in case of too rapid an application) of proactive climate policies. Global warming (resp. too fast transition) forces the private sector to leverage in order to compensate for output and capital losses (resp. to lower carbon emissions), thus endangering financial stability; 3) Implementing an adequate carbon price trajectory, as well as increasing the wage share, fostering employment, and reducing private debt make it easier to avoid unintended degrowth and to reach a +2.5 \textdegree C target.},

Parte-se da hip\'otese de que o processo de financeiriza\c{c}\~ao, ocorrido em n\'ivel mundial, expressa-se no Brasil com especificidades e incompletudes, ainda que alinhado ao de outros pa\'ises, tendo relev\^ancia crescente na pol\'itica social, na qual o sistema de educa\c{c}\~ao superior se destaca como elemento representativo. Assim, \'e inicialmente realizada uma conceitua\c{c}\~ao geral do fen\^omeno por meio de sentidos espec\'ificos, posicionando a quest\~ao abordada. Ap\'os isso, investiga-se suas origens no Brasil e a forma pela qual esse atualmente se manifesta. Por fim, utilizam-se os sentidos previamente definidos para apontar a financeiriza\c{c}\~ao ocorrida na educa\c{c}\~ao superior privada em per\'iodos recentes. Essa \'e apresentada por duas \'oticas: de um lado, um maior endividamento das fam\'ilias atrav\'es de um cr\'edito educacional subsidiado pelo governo, e, de outro, grandes conglomerados educacionais com atitudes de mercado altamente agressivas, em busca de uma valoriza\c{c}\~ao acion\'aria r\'apida e constante. O papel do Estado \'e visto como fundamental nesse processo, tanto atrav\'es de um custoso sistema de cr\'edito educacional (FIES), quanto de um subs\'idio direto e expressivo \`as empresas educacionais (PROUNI). O que se encontra \'e um crescente n\'umero de alunos beneficiados e progressivamente endividados, anexo a uma forte mudan\c{c}a nesse setor, com grande n\'umero de fus\~oes e aquisi\c{c}\~oes, acompanhada de uma concentra\c{c}\~ao de mercado pari passu a entrada dessas grandes corpora\c{c}\~oes no mercado acion\'ario, com valoriza\c{c}\~ao acelerada.

The model's extensions, other than allowing for the incorporation of an increasing number of economic characteristics originally proposed by Kaldor, also have considerably increased the analytical scope of the field by establishing theoretical links with other schools of thought. A neo-schumpeterian view is possible via the introduction of the impacts of technological gaps and innovation into the models. In its turn, a structuralist perspective is obtained by decomposing trade elasticities. Finally, from kaleckian growth models, the importance of a multi-sectoral analysis and of distinct distributive regimes over economic growth is brought to the models.},

  abstract = {Resumo: O modelo supermultiplicador (Serrano, 1995; Bortis, 1997) tem ganhado espa\c{c}o no debate p\'os-keynesiano. Na sua vers\~ao mais recente, o modelo combina o gasto aut\^onomo, que cresce a uma taxa dada exogenamente, com o comportamento harrodiano das firmas (Freitas, 2015; Allain, 2015; Lavoie, 2016). Isso permite que a capacidade se ajuste \`a demanda no longo prazo, com o grau de utiliza\c{c}\~ao retornando ao seu n\'ivel considerado normal. O pressuposto de que o crescimento do gasto aut\^onomo \'e ex\'ogeno exclui, quase que por defini\c{c}\~ao, a possibilidade de que altera\c{c}\~oes na distribui\c{c}\~ao de renda e nos gastos induzidos (nas propens\~oes a gastar) tenham efeitos permanentes de crescimento. Al\'em disso, tais modelos s\~ao, em sua maioria, modelos de fluxo que omitem os determinantes financeiros do gasto aut\^onomo e as implica\c{c}\~oes das intera\c{c}\~oes entre fluxos e estoques na economia. Levando isso em considera\c{c}\~ao, a tese se prop\~oe a avaliar os resultados do modelo supermultiplicador quando o pressuposto original - de que o crescimento do componente aut\^onomo de demanda \'e completamente ex\'ogeno - \'e relaxado. A tese ainda busca analisar as caracter\'isticas do modelo supermultiplicador quando estendido a uma estrutura financeira mais complexa, que considere n\~ao apenas os fluxos e o estoque de capital, mas tamb\'em os estoques financeiros. Adota-se para tal a metodologia Stock-Flow Consistent, que permite conciliar ambos objetivos. Procura-se mostrar que a endogeneiza\c{c}\~ao do gasto aut\^onomo altera alguns resultados de longo prazo do modelo original. Isso significa que, assim como nos modelos neo-kaleckianos, \'e poss\'ivel que, no modelo supermultiplicador, mudan\c{c}as na distribui\c{c}\~ao de renda, assim como a expans\~ao da demanda via propens\~oes a gastar, tenham efeitos permanentes de crescimento. Os efeitos de crescimento s\~ao ainda reavaliados em uma estrutura que incorpora (a) o conflito distributivo entre trabalhadores e capitalistas, o crescimento end\'ogeno da produtividade do trabalho e o emprego; (b) a intera\c{c}\~ao entre duas economias semelhantes sob diferentes regimes cambiais. No cap\'itulo dois, A Supermultiplier Stock-Flow Consistent model: the ''return'' of the paradoxes of thrift and costs in the long run?, o gasto aut\^onomo \'e endogeneizado (consumo a partir da riqueza) e os paradoxos da poupan\c{c}a e dos custos s\~ao avaliados no longo prazo. Os resultados das simula\c{c}\~oes num\'ericas indicam que o paradoxo da poupan\c{c}a permanece v\'alido e que uma parcela de lucros mais baixa pode estar associada a taxas mais elevadas de acumula\c{c}\~ao de capital, embora com taxas de lucro mais baixas. No cap\'itulo tr\^es, Conficting-claims and labour market concerns in a Supermultiplier model, o modelo do cap\'itulo dois \'e estendido para dar conta da din\^amica do mercado de trabalho. A infla\c{c}\~ao \'e incorporada no modelo via conflito distributivo entre trabalhadores e capitalistas e o crescimento end\'ogeno da produtividade do trabalho \'e introduzido, configurando a endogeneiza\c{c}\~ao da distribui\c{c}\~ao de renda. No cap\'itulo quatro, Growth and distribution in a Two-Country Supermultiplier Stock-Flow Consistent model, o modelo do cap\'itulo 1 \'e estendido para um sistema de dois pa\'ises com caracter\'isticas semelhantes. Os resultados das simula\c{c}\~oes num\'ericas indicam que tanto uma redu\c{c}\~ao no mark-up das firmas quanto o aumento na propens\~ao a consumir a partir da renda t\^em efeito positivo de crescimento sobre as duas economias em ambos os regimes de c\^ambio, fixo e flutuante. Al\'em disso, se a condi\c{c}\~ao de Marshall-Lerner for v\'alida, a economia que expande sua demanda dom\'estica ganha relativamente mais do que a economia parceira (aumenta a sua participa\c{c}\~ao no estoque de capital do sistema). O regime de c\^ambio ainda influencia, al\'em da distribui\c{c}\~ao de renda, a distribui\c{c}\~ao de riqueza entre as economias. Por fim, um est\'imulo coordenado \`a demanda faz ambas economias crescerem a uma taxa mais elevada em compara\c{c}\~ao a um choque isolado \`a demanda em uma das economias},

Preliminary results suggest that the paradox of debt in firms' sector is not a necessary result of supermultiplier models. As for households sector, the paradox of debt is a feature of the canonical supermultiplier model, yet there may be episodes of rising debt-to-income ratios and financial crisis as precipitated by policy decisions.},

Three linkages of financial engineering to effective demand are identified: (1) funding effects, (2) liquidity preference or speculative effects, and (3) balance sheet or Minsky effects. Data from the Survey of Consumer Finances are used to investigate the importance of asset-backed security-related funding and balance sheet (Minsky) effects in the United States. Evidence is shown that financial engineering has boosted borrowing power at all income levels. The liberal use of expanded borrowing opportunities has fueled the growth of consumption-especially since 1995. However, a secularly rising share of U.S. households have entered the categories of "speculative" or "Ponzi" finance units-a factor that raises doubts about the sustainability of the current spending boom.]},

  abstract = {China is the leading ammonia producer and relies on a coal-based technology which makes the already energy intensive Haber-Bosch process, one of the most emission intensive in the world This work is the first to propose an agent-based modelling framework to model the Chinese ammonia industry as it characterises the specific goals and barriers towards fuel switching and carbon capture and storage adoption for small, medium, and large enterprises either private or state-owned. The results show that facilitated access to capital makes investments in sustainable technologies more attractive for all firms, especially for small and medium enterprises. Without policy instruments such as carbon price, the decrease in emissions in the long-term is due to investments in natural gas-based technologies, as they typically have lower capital and operating costs, and also lower electricity consumption than coal-based production. Conversely, with policy instruments in place, a strong decrease in emissions occurs between 2060 and 2080 due to investors choosing natural gas and biomethane-based technologies, with carbon capture and storage. In the long term, natural gas and biomethane could compete, with the outcome depending on infrastructure, supply chain availability and land use constraints.},

We analyze the cyclical properties of house prices and quantities and compare them with the aggregate economic cycle. We study the effects of monetary policy shocks on the housing market in a Structural VAR model with Italian data for 1990-2008.We find evidence that monetary policy strongly affects the behavior of real house prices and investment. Furthermore their response is significantly more sluggish than that of economic activity, suggesting that the housing market might contribute to the persistent propagation of the shocks hitting the economic system. Despite their influence on housing variables, monetary policy shocks are not the predominant cause of the volatility of residential investment and house prices},

This new approach rejects the assumption of slope homogeneity and handles nonstationarity. It also recognizes that cross-section dependence (that is, some correlation structure in the error term between units due to unobservable common factors) squanders efficiency gains by operating with a panel. This approach uses a new set of estimators known in the literature as the common correlated effect, which essentially consists of increasing the model to be fit by adding the averages of the individuals in each time t, of both the dependent variable and the specific regressors of each individual. We present two commands developed for the evaluation and treatment of cross-section dependence.},

To this effect, a computer simulation model was developed to capture the effects on the balance of payments and on economic growth rates under different growth patterns. The main conclusions drawn were: i) growth rates of an economy in which the dynamics are exclusively driven by internal conditions will, from a certain point, be constrained by the rise in external vulnerability; ii) if productive sectors are able to introduce innovative dynamics increasing the competitiveness of their products and therefore the export coefficients, economic growth will be driven by internal demand, postponing, although not precluding, the risk of foreign vulnerability.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the restructuring of the Spanish financial system. This study is justified by the massive economic and social impact of this process in Spain. Based on the annual accounts and the annual reports of Spanish credit institutions, a model was created to predict the possibility of bank failure or bailout. The variables were selected following a review of the literature. They included the legal form of the credit institution (savings bank versus bank), leverage, real estate investment, gross operating margin, staff costs and non-performing loans. Two variables that had not previously been used in studies of this type were also included in the model: risk-weighted assets and coverage (as part of the provisions for non-performing loans). Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was used for the analysis. Use of fsQCA is another novel aspect of this study. This technique has never been used to predict corporate bankruptcy or the failure of credit institutions. Proposals were made and tested using data on Spanish banks and savings banks for the year 2010, a critical year for the Spanish financial system. The results yield several interesting conclusions. First, greater leverage increases the probability of survival, contrary to the opinion of most scholars. This result shows that the problem facing Spanish credit institutions was the closure of international markets, not the level of debt. Another key conclusion is that financial institutions with higher staff costs have a greater chance of survival. Therefore, the widespread policy of reducing human resource costs should be reconsidered. Finally, the risk-weighted assets measure offers an excellent predictor of failure of credit institutions, as well as providing other benefits, which substantially increase the value of this measure.},

The exact magnitude of this shock to the world economy is uncertain, but many believe that the setback in GDP will be on a scale similar to, if not worse than, the first years of the Great Recession. As such, there is an imperative need for policy actions of a Keynesian nature, as have already been implemented in many countries. In the present paper, with Denmark as a case study, using an SFC modelling approach, some aspects of the negative economic impact of the COVID-19 virus on the Danish economy are highlighted, as are the consequences of the policy actions adopted by the Danish Parliament.},

Desta vez, os efeitos foram suficientemente graves para que a crise fosse comparada \`a de 1929. Por seus impactos negativos sobre o ritmo de crescimento econ\^omico, nos Estados Unidos e no mundo \textquestiondown{} que at\'e 2017 n\~ao havia retomado os patamares anteriores \`a crise \textquestiondown{} e pelo acirramento de conflitos sociais que se seguiu, a crise das hipotecas subprime parece ter explicitado as contradi\c{c}\~oes da configura\c{c}\~ao contempor\^anea do capitalismo americano, em que as finan\c{c}as s\~ao capazes de impor sua l\'ogica e seus condicionantes ao processo de acumula\c{c}\~ao, dando origem a um regime de acumula\c{c}\~ao financeirizado. Se os im\'oveis residenciais e seus v\'inculos com os mercados financeiros estiveram no epicentro da mais grave crise do regime financeirizado, encontravam-se igualmente presentes na fase anterior de ascens\~ao do ciclo, mesmo antes de 2002, quando a acelera\c{c}\~ao do processo de valoriza\c{c}\~ao das resid\^encias americanas, apoiada na pol\'itica de baixas taxa de juros do Federal Reserve, liderou a recupera\c{c}\~ao econ\^omica dos EUA, compensando os efeitos negativos da desvaloriza\c{c}\~ao dos mercados acion\'arios. O objetivo dessa tese \'e, \`a luz dos eventos revelados pela crise subprime, identificar as transforma\c{c}\~oes institucionais que possibilitaram que os im\'oveis residenciais desempenhassem um papel central no regime de acumula\c{c}\~ao financeirizado dos EUA, tanto nas fases de crescimento econ\^omico como na crise que se seguiu. Em outros termos, busca-se mostrar que novas formas de financiar, gerir e construir esses ativos imobili\'arios tamb\'em integraram as transforma\c{c}\~oes ocorridas, a partir dos anos 1970 e 1980, que deram os contornos da configura\c{c}\~ao atual do capitalismo americano},

  abstract = {The global financial crisis has forced standard macroeconomics to re-examine the plausibility of its assumptions and the adequacy of the policy prescriptions flowing from those assumptions. We believe a renewal of macroeconomic thinking and macroeconomic modeling is possible by recognizing that our economies should be analyzed as complex adaptive systems. A coherent and exhaustive representation of the inter-linkages between the real and financial sides of the economy is vital as well. We propose a macroeconomic framework based on a novel combination of the Agent Based and Stock Flow Consistent approaches. This paper presents a benchmark model for this innovative approach. Our model depicts an economy with capital and credit in which different types of agents locally interact on different markets. We provide a detailed representation of individual agents' balance sheets, ensuring the model accounting consistency at the micro, meso, and macro levels. We analyze the properties of our simulated economy under different configurations of agent heuristics, focusing in particular on the role of credit and investment. We explain in detail the logic followed to calibrate and validate the model. Results show that our benchmark model is able to reproduce many stylized facts observed in real world, thus representing a good starting point to test -- in the next works -- different economic policies and institutional setups. Finally, the relatively simple and flexible structure of the model opens up many possibilities for development of the framework along different lines, thus providing a fertile soil for new applications.},

  abstract = {We argue that a fundamental difference between the various post-Keynesian approaches to economic growth lies in their treatment of investment. Neo-Kaleckian models, which are more appropriately Robinsonian models, postulate an investment function dependent on profitability, and that is partly autonomous from income. Some of these models rely on the importance of profitability, captured by the profit share, to make the case for profit-led growth. For their part, Kaldorian models, which are in our view compatible with Sraffian models, place the emphasis on the accelerator in the determination of investment. More importantly, since investment is a derived demand, that is, ruled by the adjustment of capacity to autonomous demand, there is a tendency to a normal level of capacity utilization. These are supermultiplier models. In our view the Kaldorian approach is better equipped to deal with some of the issues relating income distribution to accumulation with effective demand in an open economy in the long run. We develop an open economy model to examine the conditions under which an increase in real wages can produce wage-led growth, showing that the limit to wage-led expansion is a binding external constraint. The model is unique in emphasizing the role of income distribution in affecting real exchange rates, and it is through this channel that the ambiguous effects of income distribution on growth arise. We also provide some evidence indicating that real wages are positively related to growth, investment, and capacity utilization, and we highlight the role of finance in sustaining expansions suggesting that debt-led growth should not be identified with profit-led growth.},

By means of an agent-based model, we replicate an artificial creditnetwork economy in order to assess the impact of growing income inequality in the presence of peer effects and home equity borrowing. We show that the resulting debt-financed consumption boom jeopardises the stability of the economic system, thus paving the way for a financial crisis. Our model includes a behavioural rule for consumption based on expenditure cascades, a hierarchical structure of household finance, an articulated credit market with collateralised consumption loans and mortgages and a simple housing market. Results show that the model is able to capture the economic and social pressure of inequality on low and middle income households that pushes them to increase their consumption via home equity extraction. Rising non-performing loans lead to higher bad debt on the banks' balance sheets and, consequently, to the emergence of a crisis as an endogenous dynamic.},

No plano estrutural, desde os anos 1990, ocorre a crescente integra\c{c}\~ao da economia brasileira a uma economia financeirizada nos pa\'ises desenvolvidos, marcada por recorrentes bolhas de pre\c{c}os de ativos e por uma crise financeira de grandes propor\c{c}\~oes em 2008. Medidas de pol\'itica econ\^omica para lidar com essa crise, nos pa\'ises centrais, fundadas na pol\'itica monet\'aria n\~ao convencional, exacerbaram os ciclos de liquidez, subjacentes \`as bolhas. No \^ambito produtivo, observou-se a constitui\c{c}\~ao de cadeias globais de valor com a fragmenta\c{c}\~ao das etapas produtivas, originando uma intensifica\c{c}\~ao da concorr\^encia fundada na redu\c{c}\~ao de pre\c{c}os, acentuada ap\'os a crise em raz\~ao do aparecimento de capaci-dade ociosa generalizada, mormente na China. No plano dom\'estico, a economia brasileira assistiu no per\'iodo 2003/2010 a uma acelera\c{c}\~ao do crescimento impulsionado, inicialmente, pelos pre\c{c}os das commodities e, posteriormente, pelo r\'apido crescimento do consumo, e por fim, mas n\~ao por \'ultimo, pelo investimento, induzido por ambos. Esse ciclo, embora peculiar por se acompanhar da melhoria da distribui\c{c}\~ao da renda, perdeu pro-gressivamente dinamismo. Em parte, pela perda de velocidade da melhoria da distribui\c{c}\~ao fundada em mecanismos salariais, mas principalmente pelos limites ao endividamento das fam\'ilias. Ademais, os programas p\'ublicos de transfer\^encia de renda, muito relevantes para explicar a melhoria da distribui\c{c}\~ao, alcan\c{c}aram um limite no quadro fiscal prevalecente. O investimento, por sua vez, teve seu dinamismo atenuado pelo vazamento de parte da demanda de m\'aquinas e equi-pamentos e insumos intermedi\'arios para o exterior, em raz\~ao da especializa\c{c}\~ao regressiva. O arrefecimento do ciclo de 2003/2010 impunha a busca de um novo modelo de crescimento. Para tanto, a escolha recaiu na diversifica\c{c}\~ao da estrutu-ra produtiva, para suplantar a especializa\c{c}\~ao regressiva, e na amplia\c{c}\~ao da infra-estrutura, em parte sobreutilizada, em parte sucateada, por anos de baixo inves-timento.

As the Brazilian economy slowed down in more recent years, the sustainability of this growth model has been put into question. After studying the impact of different redistributive policies (e.g. minimum wage, income transfers) on the personal and functional distributions of income in Brazil, the paper discusses the response of aggregate consumption, investment and net exports \textendash{} as well as the economy's productive structure and inflation rate \textendash{} to the changes in income distribution itself and other relevant factors. The analysis allows us both to draw lessons to the Neo-Kaleckian literature on demand regimes, pointing towards the importance of some theoretical extensions, and to examine future prospects for the Brazilian economy.},

It presents a quantitative history of the movement of home prices in the USA between 1975 and 2008, including the impact of the boom-and-bust cycle of 2000-2008 on the national balance sheet, as well as the historical relationship between home prices and household income over the cycle. The chapter describes the traditional process of disequilibrium adjustment which is unique to the housing market, and which has played itself out during every previous recovery period. It presents a perspective that helps integrate the effects of the important, but seemingly disparate, aspects of the current housing crisis in the USA. These aspects include home price changes, expectations about price changes, the demand for housing, and the diffusion of relaxed mortgage underwriting standards in the USA during the period leading up to the crash in the housing market.

Relying on a mixed-methods research strategy that combines econometric and qualitative comparative analysis, it proceeds through three consecutive steps. First, there is a discussion of how democratic institutions may solicit governments' attention toward social issues. Second, the relationship between democratisation and human development in 21 post-communist countries is tested. Third, democracy in its core attributes is unpacked, and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) is used to identify a few alternative institutional configurations favouring human development. The analysis reveals that not only full democracies, but also some hybrid regimes, have been successful in this task.},

Despite the potential epistemological links between `cases' and `agents,' neither camp has leveraged their combined strengths. A bridge can be built, however, by drawing on Abbott's insight that `agents are cases doing things', Byrne's suggestion that `cases are complex systems with agency', and by viewing CBM and ABM within the broader trend towards computational modelling of cases. To demonstrate the utility of this bridge, we describe how CBM can utilise ABM to identify case-based trends; explore the interactions and collective behaviour of cases; and study different scenarios. We also describe how ABM can utilise CBM to identify agent types; construct agent behaviour rules; and link these to outcomes to calibrate and validate model results. To further demonstrate the bridge, we review a public health study that made initial steps in combining CBM and ABM.},

  abstract = {This paper delivers new evidence on the individual and policy drivers of residential mobility, covering a wide range of housing-related policies and conditions but also other relevant policy areas. The analysis uses household-level micro datasets allowing for an investigation of the drivers of the decision to move for a large number of OECD countries; as well for identifying differential policy effects across socio-economic groups, underscoring the distributional effect of policies. The evidence strongly supports the view that housing conditions and structural policies influence people's decisions and possibilities to move. A more responsive housing supply is associated with higher residential mobility, suggesting that reforming land-use and planning policies may facilitate moving by reducing house price differences across locations. Social cash and in-kind spending on housing are positively correlated with residential mobility. Higher housing transaction costs, including from transfer taxes, are associated with lower residential mobility, especially among younger households, which are more likely to be first time-buyers. Stricter rental regulations are associated with lower residential mobility, particularly for renters, low-educated and low-income households. Beyond housing policies, more generous cash income support to low-wage jobseekers and minimum income schemes embedded in social transfers are positively associated with residential mobility; while excessive job protection on regular contracts is negatively associated with mobility, particularly for youth, low-income and low-educated individuals.},

This paper estimates long-term elasticities of housing supply to prices in OECD countries before exploring their drivers with a focus on policies. It finds a significant association between weaker supply responsiveness and a proxy measure for more restrictive land-use regulation. Besides, tighter rent controls are linked with lower supply elasticities. In turn, weak supply responsiveness implies that house prices rise more following stronger demand. The sensitivity of house prices to household income is also higher in countries that provide larger amounts of tax relief for homeowners.},

Indeed, we feel the SFC approach has recently led to a blossoming literature, requiring a new summary after the work of Dos Santos and above all after the publication of the main reference work on the methodology, Godley and Lavoie's Monetary Economics: An Integrated Approach to Credit, Money, Income, Production and Wealth. The paper is developed along the following lines. First, a brief historical analysis investigates the roots of this class of models that can be traced as far back as 1949 and the work of Copeland. Second, the competing points of view regarding some of its main controversial aspects are underlined and used to classify the different methodological approaches followed in using these models. Namely, we discuss (i) how the models are solved, (ii) the treatment of time and its implication and (ii) the need (or not) for microfoundations. These results are then used in the third section of the paper to develop a bifocal perspective, which allows us to divide the literature reviewed according to both its subject and the methodology. We explore various topics such as financialisation, exchange rate modelling, policy implication, the need for a common framework within the post-Keynesian literature and the empirical use of SFC models. Finally, the conclusions present some hypotheses (and wishes) for the possible lines of development of SFC models.},

  abstract = {The aim of the paper is to provide an overview of the current stock-flow consistent (SFC) literature. Indeed, we feel the SFC approach has recently led to a blossoming literature, requiring a new summary after the work of Dos Santos (2006) and, above all, after the publication of the main reference work on the methodology, Godley and Lavoie's Stock-flow Consistent Approach (2007). The paper is developed along the following lines. First, a brief historical analysis investigates the roots of this class of models that can be traced as far back as 1949 and the work of Copeland. Second, the competing points of view regarding some of its main controversial aspects are underlined and used to classify the different methodological approaches followed in using these models. Namely, we discuss (1) how the models are solved, (2) the treatment of time and its implication, and (3) the need-or not-of microfoundations. These results are then used in the third section of the paper to develop a bifocal perspective, which allows us to divide the literature reviewed according to both its subject and the methodology. We explore various topics such as financialization, exchange rate modeling, policy implication, the need for a common framework within the post-Keynesian literature, and the empirical use of SFC models. Finally, the conclusions present some hypotheses (and wishes) over the possible lines of development of the stock-flow consistent models.},

  abstract = {This article analyzes the conditions under which ethnic minorities intensify or moderate their protest behavior. While this question has been previously asked, we find that prior studies tend to generalize explanations across a varied set of ethnic groups and assume that causal conditions can independently explain whether groups are more or less mobilized. By contrast, this study employs a technique \textendash{} fuzzy-set analysis \textendash{} that is geared toward matching comparable groups to specific analytical configurations of causal factors to explain the choice for strong and weak protest. The analysis draws on a sample of 29 ethnic minorities in Europe and uses three group and two contextual conditions inspired by Gurr's ethnopolitical conflict model to understand why some ethnic minorities protest more frequently than others. We find that two group-related factors have the strongest claim to being generalizable: while territorial concentration is a necessary condition for strong protest, national pride is a necessary condition for weak protest. The contextual factors of level of democracy and ethnic fractionalization, which are often emphasized in the literature, and the perceived political discrimination of a group, are neither necessary nor individually sufficient conditions for either strong or weak protest. Hence, they help understanding some cases, but not all, and only in combination with other conditions. Such causal complexity, inherent in the phenomenon of ethnic protest, underscores the need for a case-sensitive, yet comparative, approach.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes the predictive ability of aggregate and dis-aggregate proxies of investor sentiment, over and above standard macroeconomic predictors, in forecasting housing returns in China, using an array of machine learning models. Using a monthly out-of-sample period of 2011:01 to 2018:12, given an in-sample of 2006:01-2010:12, we find that indeed the new aligned investor sentiment index proposed in this paper has greater predictive power for housing returns than the a principal component analysis (PCA)-based sentiment index, used earlier in the literature. Moreover, shrinkage models utilizing the dis-aggregate sentiment proxies do not result in forecast improvement indicating that aligned sentiment index optimally exploits information in the dis-aggregate proxies of investor sentiment. Furthermore, when we let the machine learning models to choose from all key control variables and the aligned sentiment index, the forecasting accuracy is improved at all forecasting horizons, rather than just the short-run as witnessed under standard predictive regressions. This result suggests that machine learning methods are flexible enough to capture both structural change and time-varying information in a set of predictors simultaneously to forecast housing returns of China in a precise manner. Given the role of the real estate market in China's economic growth, our result of accurate forecasting of housing returns, based on investor sentiment and macroeconomic variables using state-of-the-art machine learning methods, has important implications for both investors and policymakers.},

  abstract = {With some exceptions, non-orthodox economists share the `Keynesian Hypothesis' of the independence of investment from capacity-savings, in the long-run no less than the short-run. This hypothesis marks an essential point of difference from neo-classical theory. Keynes showed that within the limits of the existing capacity utilisation, it is investment that determines savings. The correct way to extend this conclusion to the long run is the object of the present paper. In particular, it provides an assessment of the controversy on demand-led growth theory that has taken place since the mid-1980s between neo-Kaleckian and Sraffian authors, particularly those closer to the late Piero Garegnani's `surplus approach'. For the sake of the argument the Sraffian front is divided between a first and a second Sraffian position (the second defined as Sraffian supermultiplier approach). Although I argue that the second approach is the most promising, the dissention should not be over-emphasised, so will also often generically refer to Sraffian authors.},

In this sense we supplement the surplus approach with important insights from the Polanyian approach, from economic archaeology and anthropology, but also from Sraffian authors and Sraffa's manuscripts. Taking inspiration from Garegnani's core while also considering its specificities, this work is a premise to the design of different economic ``cores'' for different stylized economic formations.},

Unfortunately, Diamond does not mention the origin of the concept in classical and pre-classical economics, nor does he pay much attention to debates in economic anthropology about the role of economic analysis in studying primitive and ancient economic formations. These debates were the subject of a recent book by Cedrini \& Marchionatti (2017), who dispute the neoclassical ``imperialist'' attempt to occupy the territory of economic anthropology. The authors rely on the institutionalist background provided by Karl Polanyi and his school and by other anthropologists of similar inspiration. Polanyians, however, fail to complete their institutional analysis by anchoring it to the changing modes of generation and distribution of the economic surplus. Yet their emphasis on the need to introduce institutions from the beginning, when speaking of economic surplus, should be taken into consideration by the classical surplus approach},

Three concepts of consumption are investigated: total households consumption expenditure, consumption excluding financial services and consumption excluding durable goods. Different estimators are also considered. Based on the MPC approach, when considered as permanent by households, an increase (decrease) in total wealth of one euro would lead to an increase (decrease) of 1 cent in total consumption. In terms of elasticity, an increase (decrease) of 10\% in wealth would imply also a relatively small impact of 0.8 to 1.1\% on consumption depending on the concept of consumption considered. In most cases, the effect of a change in financial wealth is bigger than of a change in housing wealth. The results indicate that the wealth effects in France are smaller than in the UK and US but close to what is observed in Italy. In addition, any deviation of the variables from their common trends is corrected at first by adjustments in disposable income in line with what has been uncovered by studies on Germany and consistent with the ''saving for the rainy days'' approach of Campbell (1987). But our results contrast with the seminal study of Lettau and Ludvigson (2004) in the US where asset prices make the bulk of the adjustment.},

  abstract = {For decades, performance comparisons between real estate and financial assets have repeatedly indicated that private real estate investment exhibits significantly higher risk-adjusted returns than publicly traded financial assets such as common stocks. That is, there is an apparent ``real estate risk premium puzzle.'' In this paper, we find that the seemingly superior risk-adjusted returns of real estate may be caused by inappropriate adoption of the conventional risk measure to real estate, a measure that completely ignores the non-i.i.d. nature of the asset's return distribution, as well as its illiquidity risk. We develop a modified performance measure\textemdash a Sharpe ratio for real estate\textemdash to capture the time-dependent nature of real estate risk by incorporating illiquidity risk in a closed-form formula. Our finding shows that, once the real estate risk is properly measured, the longstanding ``real estate risk premium puzzle'' no longer exists. Our approach also shows that real estate price risk over time can be accurately obtained through empirical estimation without relying on a simplification assumption of a particular distribution like the i.i.d. assumption.},

This paper reached three conclusions: first, housing financialization and land financialization cannot be separated in China; housing financialization boosts the demand for housing assets and land financialization speeds up the supply to meet the demand. Second, housing financialization and land financialization jointly expand the production of properties and sustain capital accumulation. Third, the financialization of land and housing evolve over time. We conclude that the separate and related processes of housing and land financialization in China reflect the unique characteristics of the state ownership of land in China.},

Recently developed econometric techniques for panel unit root testing and heterogeneous panel cointegration analysis are employed. The empirical results provide clear support of a stable long-run relationship between housing investment, non-housing investment and GDP in China. We then estimate the long-run elasticity of GDP with respect to housing investment for the whole country as well as three sub regions. The variations across regions are detected and reasons for this fact are discussed. Based on the panel ECM, we show that there is bidirectional Granger causality between housing investment and GDP in both short run and long run for the whole country, while the impacts of housing investment on GDP behave strikingly differently in the three sub-regions of China.},

Other revealed significant covariates have different effects under the two market conditions. Our model explains the liquidity imbalance variations on the ZIP code area level well, but not on the individual property level, highlighting the importance of regional idiosyncratic transaction dynamics.},

To that end, I first discuss three pillars of a well-functioning MIS as a conceptual underpinning - intermediation efficiency, affordability enhancement, and risk management. The historical survey proceeds based on four reasonably distinct time periods \textendash{} (1) the era of exploration (pre-1930s or pre-Great Depression era), (2) the era of institutionalization (1930s to 1960s), (3) the era of market-making (1970s and 1980s), and (4) the era of expansion and efficiency gain (1990s to Present). Based on the survey done, the lessons for other countries are organized under five topics: developing conforming mortgage product and market; extending the service to non-conforming segments; managing default and prepayment risks; managing systemic risk; and, developing an efficient intermediation process. The concluding remarks in the final section comprise the issue of right sequencing: that is, through what steps an MIS in a given country can be evolved toward a more market-based one that can deliver a higher degree of consumer welfare.},

  abstract = {Objective To identify high-performance work practices (HPWP) associated with high frontline health care worker (FLW) job satisfaction and perceived quality of care. Methods Cross-sectional survey data from 661 FLWs in 13 large health care employers were collected between 2007 and 2008 and analyzed using both regression and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. Principal Findings Supervisor support and team-based work practices were identified as necessary for high job satisfaction and high quality of care but not sufficient to achieve these outcomes unless implemented in tandem with other HPWP. Several configurations of HPWP were associated with either high job satisfaction or high quality of care. However, only one configuration of HPWP was sufficient for both: the combination of supervisor support, performance-based incentives, team-based work, and flexible work. These findings were consistent even after controlling for FLW demographics and employer type. Additional research is needed to clarify whether HPWP have differential effects on quality of care in direct care versus administrative workers. Conclusions High-performance work practices that integrate FLWs in health care teams and provide FLWs with opportunities for participative decision making can positively influence job satisfaction and perceived quality of care, but only when implemented as bundles of complementary policies and practices.},

  abstract = {The Great Financial Crisis of 2007-09 confirmed the vital importance of advancing our understanding of macrofinancial linkages, the two-way interactions between the real economy and the financial sector. The crisis was a bitter reminder of how sharp fluctuations in asset prices, credit and capital flows can have dramatic impact on the financial positions of households, corporations and sovereign nations. As fluctuations were amplified, the global financial system was brought to the brink of collapse and the deepest contraction in world output in more than half a century followed. Moreover, unprecedented challenges for fiscal, monetary and financial regulatory policies resulted. The crisis revived an old debate in the economics profession about the importance of macrofinancial linkages. Some argue that the crisis was a painful reminder of our limited knowledge of these linkages. Others claim that the profession had already made substantial progress in understanding them but that there was too much emphasis on narrow approaches and modelling choices. Yet, most also recognise that the absence of a unifying framework to study these two-way interactions has limited the practical applications of existing knowledge and impeded the formulation of policies. With these observations in mind, this paper presents a systematic review of the rapidly expanding literature on macrofinancial linkages. It first surveys the literature on the linkages between asset prices and macroeconomic outcomes. It then reviews the literature on the macroeconomic implications of financial imperfections. It also examines the global dimensions of macrofinancial linkages and documents the main stylized facts about the linkages between the real economy and the financial sector. The topic of macrofinancial linkages promises to remain an exciting area of research, given the many open questions and significant policy interest. The paper concludes with a discussion of possible directions for future research, stressing the need for richer theoretical models, more robust empirical work and better quality data so as to advance knowledge and help guide policymakers going forward},

  abstract = {We investigate the effect of house prices on household borrowing using administrative mortgage data from the United Kingdom and a new empirical approach. The data contain household-level information on house prices and borrowing in a panel of homeowners, who refinance at regular and quasi-exogenous intervals. The data and setting allow us to develop an empirical approach that exploits house price variation coming from the idiosyncratic and exogenous timing of refinance events around the Great Recession. We present two main results. First, there is a clear and robust effect of house prices on borrowing. Second, the effect of house prices on borrowing can be explained largely by collateral effects. We study the collateral channel through a multivariate and nonparametric heterogeneity analysis of proxies for collateral and wealth effects.},

  abstract = {One suggested hypothesis for the dramatic rise in household borrowing that preceded the financial crisis is that low-income households increased their demand for credit to finance higher consumption expenditures in order to "keep up" with higher-income households. Using household level data on debt accumulation during 2001-2012, we show that low-income households in high-inequality regions accumulated less debt relative to income than their counterparts in lower-inequality regions, which negates the hypothesis. We argue instead that these patterns are consistent with supply-side interpretations of debt accumulation patterns during the 2000s. We present a model in which banks use applicants' incomes, combined with local income inequality, to infer the underlying type of the applicant, so that banks ultimately channel more credit toward lower-income applicants in low-inequality regions than high-inequality regions. We confirm the predictions of the model using data on individual mortgage applications in high- and low-inequality regions over this time period.},

  abstract = {Following the global financial crisis, many countries have introduced or tightened macroprudential policies. Using an agentbased model (ABM), this paper seeks to measure the impact on house price cycles of two distinct borrower-based macroprudential instruments, namely loan-to-income and loan-to-value ratios. The use of an ABM allows for the consideration of the effects of these policies on the distribution of heterogeneous households. The paper shows that the relation between tightening an instrument and its effect on house price fluctuations may be highly non-linear, depending on the distribution of households for which the instrument becomes binding. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that the marginal effect of tightening one instrument generally depends on the calibration of the other instrument. From a policy perspective, these findings highlight the importance of using granular data - preferably at the household level - when calibrating borrower- based macroprudential instruments. Likewise, the findings demonstrate the importance of macroprudential authorities establishing a coherent framework where the effects of different measures are evaluated together.},

As with all techniques that become available in easy-to-use software packages, there is a danger that QCA will come to be used in a routinised manner, with not enough attention being paid to its particular strengths and weaknesses. Users of fsQCA in particular need to be very aware of particular problems that can arise when fuzzy logic lies behind their analyses. This paper aims to increase its readers' understanding of some of these problems and of some means by which they might be alleviated. We use a critical discussion of a recent paper by Freitag and Schlicht addressing social inequality in education in Germany as our vehicle. After summarising the substantive claims of the paper, we explain some key features of QCA. We subsequently discuss two main issues, (i) limited diversity and the various ways of using counterfactual reasoning to address it, and (ii) the logical paradoxes that can arise when using fsQCA. Making different choices than Freitag and Schlicht do in respect of dealing with these two issues, we undertake some reanalysis of their data, showing that their conclusions must be treated with some caution. We end by drawing some general lessons for users of QCA.},

Using geographic variation in mortality during the 1918 Flu Pandemic in the U.S., we find that more exposed areas experience a sharp and persistent decline in economic activity. The estimates imply that the pandemic reduced manufacturing output by 18\%. The downturn is driven by both supply and demand-side channels. Further, building on findings from the epidemiology literature establishing that NPIs decrease influenza mortality, we use variation in the timing and intensity of NPIs across U.S. cities to study their economic effects. We find that cities that intervened earlier and more aggressively do not perform worse and, if anything, grow faster after the pandemic is over. Our findings thus indicate that NPIs not only lower mortality; they may also mitigate the adverse economic consequences of a pandemic.},

  abstract = {As financial markets move toward increased globalization, it becomes worth considering whether inherent differences in financial markets across different countries will diminish. For two countries more similar than different in terms of geography, location, government and culture, Canada and the U.S. remain strikingly different in terms of housing finance. Public policy objectives toward housing followed quite different paths over the past seventy years and fundamental differences in banking practices have led to considerably different outcomes in terms of mortgage finance instruments in the two countries. In light of that, it is particularly surprising that homeownership rates do not diverge by much, reaching 67\% in the United States and 64\% in Canada by year-end 2000. We examine some of the differences in policy and in competitive practices between Canada and the U.S. in an attempt to illuminate why differences in rates and terms across the two countries still exist. While a part of the difference remains due to legal constraints concerning the finance of the domestic housing sector, we do not attempt an analysis of the legal structure and focus, rather, on the economics and public policy choices that have led to the observed differences.},

  abstract = {We study the effects of monetary policy on income and wealth inequality in an agentbased stock-flow consistent model. The model analyses the behaviour and the financial position of heterogeneous households as part of a dynamic macroeconomic system in which the financial decisions of firms and banks have distributional effects. The balance sheet structure of households is calibrated using the micro data of the Survey for Consumer Finances (SCF). We pay attention to four distribution channels of monetary policy: the interest income channel, the macroeconomic activity channel, the portfolio reallocation channel and the indebtedness channel. We find that the strength of the distributional effects of monetary policy depends on various behavioural and institutional factors, including the sensitivity of investment to profitability, the responsiveness of wages to unemployment, the household emulation motive, banks' credit provision behaviour and the responsiveness of the propensity to consume to changes in the interest rates. Prior knowledge of these factors is necessary in order to identify whether a monetary policy shock is likely to have an economically significant impact on inequality.},

Emphasis is placed on the impact of climate change damages on the price of financial assets and the financial position of firms and banks. The model is estimated and calibrated using global data and simulations are conducted for the period 2016\textendash 2120. Four key results arise. First, by destroying the capital of firms and reducing their profitability, climate change is likely to gradually deteriorate the liquidity of firms, leading to a higher rate of default that could harm both the financial and the non-financial corporate sector. Second, climate change damages can lead to a portfolio reallocation that can cause a gradual decline in the price of corporate bonds. Third, climate-induced financial instability might adversely affect credit expansion, exacerbating the negative impact of climate change on economic activity. Fourth, the implementation of a green corporate QE programme can reduce climate-induced financial instability and restrict global warming. The effectiveness of this programme depends positively on the responsiveness of green investment to changes in bond yields.},

  abstract = {Wynne Godley and Hyman Minsky were two macroeconomists who `saw the crisis coming'. This paper develops a simple macrodynamic model that synthesises some key perspectives of their analytical frameworks. The model incorporates Godley's financial balances approach and postulates that private sector's propensity to spend is driven by a stock-flow norm (the target net private debt-to-income ratio) that changes endogenously via a Minsky mechanism. It also includes two fiscal rules: a Maastricht-type fiscal rule, according to which the fiscal authorities adjust the government expenditures based on a target net government debt ratio; and a Godley\textendash Minsky fiscal rule, which links government expenditures with private indebtedness following a counter-cyclical logic. The analysis shows that (i) the interaction between the propensity to spend and net private indebtedness can generate cycles and instability; (ii) instability is more likely when the propensity to spend responds strongly to deviations from the stock-flow norm and when the expectations that determine the stock-flow norm are highly sensitive to the economic cycle; (iii) the Maastricht-type fiscal rule is destabilising while the Godley\textendash Minsky fiscal rule is stabilising; and (iv) the paradox of debt can apply both to the private sector and the government sector.},

The model has the following key features. First, monetary and physical stocks and flows are explicitly formalised taking into account the accounting principles and the laws of thermodynamics. Second, Georgescu-Roegen's distinction between stock-flow and fund-service resources is adopted. Third, output is demand-determined but supply constraints might arise either due to environmental damages or due to the exhaustion of natural resources. Fourth, climate change influences directly the components of aggregate demand. Fifth, finance affects macroeconomic activity and the materialisation of investment plans that determine ecological efficiency. The model is calibrated using global data. Simulations are conducted to investigate the trajectories of key environmental, macroeconomic and financial variables under (i) different assumptions about the sensitivity of economic activity to the leverage ratio of firms and (ii) different types of green finance policies.},

  abstract = {The past two decades have seen a sharp renewal of interest in the Kaleckian models of growth and distribution. These models have been put to so much use that it made us wonder if this trend was based on their ability to generate macroeconomic equilibrium variables located within a reasonable range of some conceivable economic reality. While the Kaleckians spend much time debating how much their models are wage-led vs. profit-led, our work lies upstream of these questions, for we are investigating the Kaleckian models' existence properties. We conducted a series of simulations based on a basic, three-equation model: an investment function, a savings function and an equation for the firms' objectives. By estimating the parameters composing these different functions without recourse to econometrics but by means of an economic diagnostic, and by specifying an assumed range of value for the equilibrium variable, we tested these models' ability to produce plausible results. We also tested the models' stability property. Although stability is often put forth as a prerequisite in the study of such models, in the Kaleckian literature the question of how plausible is the stability is rarely raised.},

We reviewed Pasinetti and Foley models showing that if we use the traditional definition of capital, i.e., capital as the value of productive resources (i) r {$>$} g is a necessary condition for the existence of balanced growth, and it will not lead to an explosive process of income concentration and (ii) r {$>$} i is a necessary condition for a financially robust growth path. Thus we conclude that from a post-Keynesian perspective, Piketty's argument that the root of the increase of inequality in capitalism is that the capital return rate is higher than the growth rate of the economy is wrong.},

The results con\textregistered rm that for some countries, \textregistered nancial spread variables do contain some information about future output growth and in\textasciimacron ation, with the yield curve and the reverse yield gap performing best. However, the relatively poor out-of-sample forecasting performance and/or parameter instability suggests that the need for caution in using spread variables for forecasting in EU countries.

Capital adequacy- and reserve requirements are analysed for their e{$\carriagereturn$}ect on the risk of severe downturns. We develop an agent-based macroeconomic model in which financial contagion is transmitted through balance sheets in an endogenous firm-bank network, that incorporates firm bankruptcy and heterogeneity among banks to capture the fact that contagion e{$\carriagereturn$}ects are bank-specific. Using concepts from the empirical literature to identify amplitude and duration of recessions and expansions we show that more stringent liquidity regulations are best to dampen output fluctuations and prevent severe downturns. Under such regulations both leverage along expansions and amplitude of recessions become smaller. More stringent capital requirements induce larger output fluctuations and lead to deeper, more fragile recessions. This indicates that the capital adequacy requirement is pro-cyclical and therefore not advisable as a measure to prevent financial contagion.},

Design/methodology/approach For this investigation, the authors model and estimate two dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) versions for the US economy, one with and one without the presence of residential rent. Findings The findings provide evidence that the inclusion of the rental housing market can improve the assessment of public policies and the projection of scenarios in the face of sudden macroeconomic shocks. The addition of this secondary housing market augments the effect of total factor productivity (TFP) shock on output and consumption. In addition, it increases the effect of the credit shock on the demand for housing. The latter highlights the role of credit for the real estate market. Therefore, the authors recommend that analysts and macro-prudential authorities consider adding it to their models. Originality/value The findings provide evidence that the inclusion of the rental housing market can improve the assessment of public policies and the projection of scenarios in the face of sudden macroeconomic shocks.},

We mainly focus on the ``pandemic`` view of contagion where local shocks, originating from a country or a local housing market, spread out to other domestic housing markets. An interesting finding is that, even allowing for other channels of international transmission (through global interest rates or activity), the US real house prices, which appear to be exogenous in the US dynamics, unidirectionally causes the international house price factor, which in turn causes the domestic real house price growth for several countries. The channels of contagion from the US appears therefore to be either direct, through house prices (in particular in the UK or Spain), or indirect through other variables.},

  abstract = {This paper assesses the role of \ldots nancial variables in real economic \textdaggerdbl uctuations, in view of analysing the link between \ldots nancial cycles and business cycles at the global level. A Global VAR modelling approach is used to \ldots rst assess the contribution of credit and asset price variables to real economic activity in a number of countries and regions. The GVAR model is based on 38 countries estimated over 1987-2013. An analysis on a sample excluding the post-\ldots nancial crisis period is also provided to check whether \ldots nancial variables have gained importance in explaining business cycle \textdaggerdbl uctuations over the recent past. In a second step, \ldots nancial shocks are identi\ldots ed through sign restrictions in order to illustrate how \ldots nancial and business cycles could be related. Overall, the paper shows that the importance of credit and asset price variables in explaining real economic \textdaggerdbl uctuations is relatively large, but has not signi\ldots cantly increased since the global \ldots nancial crisis. The international transmission of \ldots nancial shocks on business cycle \textdaggerdbl uctuations also tends to be large and persistent.},

The novelty of the originate-to-distribute model of finance, based on the securitization of mortgage loans, is that it has assembled the machinery to accelerate the process. The limit to credit expansion derives from the potential (full capacity) growth of output. If there is a systematic gap between both rates, the credit-led growth will eventually become a debt- burdened growth.},

The predator is the part of the financial sector that issues credit money for non-output transactions. It increases the indebtedness ratio and inflates bubbles that eventually have a negative impact on the real rate of growth (the prey). From this basis, we build a couple of models that may lead to self-contained or explosive cycles. Even in the first case, there is a risk of a financial collapse when certain variables move far away from their long-term equilibrium positions. In order to tame the cycle and avoid extreme positions, governments should ban the expansion of credit money for the purchase of assets and introduce permanent checks to risky credit.},

  author = {D'Elia, E and Gabriele, S},
  pages = {32},
  abstract = {Functional income distribution can be an important driver of inequality. When the market remuneration of labour and capital is very uneven across individuals, as they have been in recent decades, the personal distribution of income tends to polarise, jeopardising social cohesion. This explains a renewed interest in functional distribution. Nevertheless, the role of self-employed income has been often misunderstood in estimating factor income shares. National accounts provide estimates of the compensation of employees and the operating surplus, but do not refer to self-employed workers as a specific productive factor, implicitly including their income in the `mixed income' aggregate and in some other minor items. Most analysts estimate the income of self-employed workers by attributing to them the average unit compensation of the employees, although in fact this is not necessarily consistent with the GDP estimates. Other estimates take a fixed share of the `mixed income', usually the same for every country. When national accounts are very detailed, as in the case of Italy, under some assumptions it is possible to accurately estimate self-employment income from sectors' nonfinancial accounts. In this paper we analyse four estimation approaches for self-employed incomes, since only the total amount of `mixed income' received by households is available for most countries. We analyse the data of the OECD countries focusing mainly on eight large economies: the US, Japan, the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy. The results are somehow unexpected. First of all, evaluating the income of the self-employed properly, the overall labour share is declining much faster than reported by the official data in some countries, and more countries showed a decrease in the 2000s. Indeed, the real unit compensation of the self-employed declined significantly in most of the eight countries (and in some of the others) after the mid or the end of the nineties, since self-employment has been used extensively to reduce the overall labour cost. Unit labour cost (ULC) also increased much slower (or even declined more) after 2000 in most countries, shedding new light on the pattern of international competitiveness and the drivers of inflation. The share of operative surplus of non-financial and financial corporations, properly recalculated, has exhibited different dynamics, whereas the component related to imputed rentals of owner occupied houses played an unexpectedly important role. Finally, the mark-up on variable production costs has been higher than expected and its evolution has been faster in most countries than what reported before, showing a lower sensitivity to the business cycle.},

  abstract = {Schumpeter asserted that there were two types of business cycle theories: one in which cycles reflected dampened economic behavior and another in which cycles reflect explosive economic behavior. Both of these theories allowed that cycles could be either monotonic or oscillating. In this working paper, Domenico Delli Gatti, Mauro Gallegati, and Levy Institute Distinguished Scholar Hyman P. Minsky expand the alternative types of theory to three by adding one in which cycles reflect nonoscillating time series, wavelike motions, and incoherent behavior, such as those witnessed in times of runaway inflation and debt deflations. In Gatti, Gallegati, and Minsky's business cycle theory, "cycles result from the combination of endogenous interactions that can lead to incoherence" and the effects of institutions to contain these tendencies in the economy. The authors construct an accelerator-multiplier model that reflects the idea that "times series that can generate smooth growth and well-behaved cycles as possible transitory results of the economic process, but that also allow for intermittent conditions conducive to the emergence of incoherence or turbulence." This turbulence, however, can be contained by institutional factors that act as circuit breakers on the economy. Whenever institutionally determined values dominate endogenously determined values, the path of the economy is broken and an interactive process, which starts with new initial conditions, generates future values. Specifically, whenever the economy threatens to behave incoherently, these stabilizers, whether built-in or activated by government authority, prevent the economy from continuing on the prior determined path.},

  abstract = {This article presents a new methodology for multilevel analysis using a small number of cases, named Comparative Multilevel Analysis (CMA). A classic problem in comparative studies has been the presence of too many variables and too few cases. One traditional solution to this problem has been to study subsystems within a system. However, the approach has fundamental limitations: it cannot analyse subsystems from different contexts, nor can it determine how conditions on the system level influence subsystems. By proposing four additions to traditional methodology, this article offers a new method of comparing subsystems from different contexts in order to analyse the effect of context on subsystems. The author also illustrates how CMA can be combined with Qualitative Comparative Analysis and Fuzzy-set, thereby enabling these methods to be used in the study of subsystem and context effects.},

  abstract = {Contextual analyses are essential in comparative research, as they investigate the importance of contextual conditions for causal relationships. During the last decades, an increasing number of comparative studies have also focused on how contextual conditions affect causal relationships. At the same time, new comparative methods have been developed based on set-theoretical logics. Two of the most prominent methods are csQCA and fsQCA, which are used in comparative studies with increasing frequency. However, the conventional design for contextual analysis is still based on quantitative methods and the use of interaction-factors. This article discusses why the use of interaction-factors is not suitable together with QCA-methods. Instead of the conventional design, the article presents an alternative design for contextual analyses with QCA-methods grounded on subgroup-design. Based on one recently-developed methodology comparative multilevel analysis (CMA), some guidelines for performing contextual analyses with two set-theoretical methods (csQCA and fsQCA) are presented. As illustrated with examples, the combination of CMA and QCA provides opportunities to use QCA for contextual analysis.},

  abstract = {The global expansion is losing speed in the face of a major financial crisis. The slowdown has been greatest in the advanced economies, particularly in the United States, where the housing market correction continues to exacerbate financial stress. The emerging and developing economies have so far been less affected by fi nancial market developments and have continued to grow at a rapid pace, led by China and India, although activity is beginning to slow in some countries. At the same time, headline infl ation has increased around the world, boosted by the continuing buoyancy of food and energy prices. Policymakers around the world are facing a diverse and fast-moving set of challenges, and although each country's circumstances differ, in an increasingly multipolar world it will be essential to meet these challenges broadly, taking full account of cross-border interactions. The World Economic Outlook (WEO) presents the IMF staff's analysis and projections of economic developments at the global level, in major country groups (classified by region, stage of development, etc.), and in many individual countries. It focuses on major economic policy issues as well as on the analysis of economic developments and prospects. It is usually prepared twice a year, as documentation for meetings of the International Monetary and Financial Committee, and forms the main instrument of the IMF's global surveillance activities.},

This article considers the institutions of economics from a theoretical perspective, applying to economics itself ideas that have been used to study institutions in the economy and other domains. The institutions of economics are not often treated as such, but deserve attention not only because they impact the discipline, but also because they interact with economic reality, including institutions in the economy. Particularly important are the mental models socially shared by academic economists. Conformity with these institutions and their sharing can be explained by various social factors, such as the perception of legitimacy or naturality, sanctions, uncertainty, increasing returns to adoption, informational differences, lack of power, and habits. A conventional model is adopted, at least in part, because other agents adopt it, and it is arbitrary in the sense that a non-inferior alternative to it is conceivable. An epistemic social norm implies possible sanctions and may be internalized as legitimate. Despite the profound cognitive and motivational influence of a discipline's institutions, together with other conservative forces, cases of non-conformity do occur and promote change. Prestigious academics are often successful innovators.},

Some systems of mental and behavioral rules are socially shared among economic agents and policymakers in part because they are socially shared among academic economists. They may exert on economic agents and policymakers some of the same types of influence they have on economists. On the other hand, there are important limits to the influence of the institutions of economics outside academia, and institutions in the economy also influence the institutions of economics.},

More specifically, academics who do not comply with these rules are subject to punishment, while conformists may be rewarded. At the same time, many supporters of mainstream economics have internalized these rules as legitimate, in part because of the prestige of their advocates. Social sanctions and internalization characterize social norms. These institutions are also conventions. Through various mechanisms, some academics follow these rules at least in part because others have done so; in addition, the prevailing rules are not necessarily superior to existing or conceivable alternatives.The combination of social norms and conventions may have negative consequences for the discipline.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the effects of household indebtedness and housing wealth on consumption. To identify exogenous movements of housing wealth and leverage, we estimate housing supply elasticities for New Zealand urban centers. We construct synthetic panel series by using household survey data to estimate the marginal propensity to consume out of exogenous changes in housing wealth, while controlling for the household leverage ratio. Our empirical results show that, on average, the marginal propensity to consume out of housing wealth is about 3 cents out of one dollar. But it is larger, about 4 cents, in response to falling house wealth than to increasing housing wealth, about 2 cents. We further investigate the role of household indebtedness in accounting for the asymmetric effect. Our findings suggest that household leverage reinforces the housing wealth effect in a housing bust, but dampens the housing wealth effect in a boom.},

  abstract = {The present paper offers a fundamental critique of the macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy after it surveys the theoretical and empirical literature on the macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy. It emphasizes the importance of the fiscal policy after reviewing the revolution of almost all economic schools and bringing them in one summarized figure; the paper links the developmental role of the fiscal policy with the objectives and measures of the economic transformation. Thus, the importance of this study can be seen from several perspectives: First, it reviews the theoretical harvest of fiscal policy and provides a comparison between the main revolutionary Economic thoughts; the classical school, Keynesian school, and monetarist school. Then it turns to conclude the fiscal policy from the new consensus mainstream economic schools. Finally, the study presents grouped and classified empirical pieces of evidence as it divides those empirical studies into two groups; the first for developed economies and the second for developing ones. So the study is important also for the policymakers as well as scholars as it gives its recommendations upon the last analysis in the form of `policy implications'. The paper also presents a deeper look into the evaluation approaches of the macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy at the empirical level. Thus it is useful for both researchers and decision makers.},

  abstract = {We embed a competitive search model of the real estate market into a heterogeneous agent setting where households face credit constraints and idiosyncratic turnover shocks. Households can accumulate a risk-free asset to build a down payment and to smooth non-housing consumption. There is an inelastic supply of identical homes. The model is ``block recursive''. In equilibrium wealthier home buyers sort into submarkets with higher prices and shorter buying times. We identify a novel amplification mechanism, arising from sorting, by which demand shocks can substantially affect housing prices. In particular, lowering down payment requirements induces entry of new buyers in the market and higher asset accumulation by current searchers, as these agents target more expensive (less congested) submarkets. This affects the distribution of prices and trading probabilities, and thereby the wealth distribution. Our quantitative results suggest that the effects on the long-run level and dispersion of housing prices can be significant.},

Its `demand side' explanation is based on a long-run equilibrium position featuring a negative natural rate of interest. The first objective of the paper is to show that this concept is not acceptable in a neoclassical framework. This claim is made after studying plausibility of the hypotheses and logical consistency of the position in: the Euler equation, the Wicksellian/IS-LM model, the Ramsey model, and the Overlapping generations model. The second objective is to show that the long-lasting deficit-spending policy proposal, which is remarkable and should be welcomed, is inconsistent with the neoclassical framework. Without a negative natural interest rate and the zero lower bound, arguing so forcefully for deficit-spending would not be possible. The Secular Stagnation Theory can be strengthened and consistently proposed if analysis is placed outside the neoclassical framework. Demand-led models are advocated to be better equipped to account for stagnation.},

Simulation results show that income inequality is detrimental to both macro and financial stability as it leads to higher credit demands, higher unemployment rates, economic volatility, and financial fragility. Besides the importance of consumers' leveraging, deleveraging externalities are found to be equally important for the emergence of crises and financial fragility because of the liquidity risk they entail. Minsky moments are also observed; they are related to consumers' prudential behavior and their beliefs about the macroeconomic conditions. Concerning the policy relevance of our investigation, simulations allow us to highlight that the effectiveness of prudential regulation depends on the phase of the business cycle and that there is not a ``one-size-fits-all'' regulation. This study emphasizes that regulatory constraints should take into account the features of the economic agents, such as the distribution of income and their willingness to borrow, in addition to the features of the financial sector.},

Are such processes able to account for the statistical regularities which industrial structures and dynamics display? In this work we address this question by means of a simple multi-firm model formalizing the mechanisms of learning and selection. As such, despite its simplicity, the model is able to robustly reproduce an ensemble of empirical stylized facts, including ample heterogeneity in productivity distributions, persistent market turbulence, and fat-tailed distribution of growth rates.},

  abstract = {This work nests the Agent-Based macroeconomic perspective into the earlier history of macroeconomics. We discuss how the discipline in the 70's took a perverse path relying on models grounded on fictitious rational representative agent in order to try to pathetically circumvent aggregation and coordination problems. The Great Recession was a natural experiment for macroeconomics, showing the inadequacy of the predominant theoretical framework grounded on DSGE models. After discussing the pathological fallacies of the DSGE-based approach, we claim that macroeconomics should consider the economy as a complex evolving system, i.e. as an ecology populated by heterogenous agents, whose far-from-equilibrium interactions continuously change the structure of the system. This in turn implies that more is different: macroeconomics cannot be shrink to representative-agent micro, but agents' complex interactions lead to emergence of new phenomena and hierarchical structure at the macro level. This is what is taken into account by agent-based models, which provide a novel way to model complex economies from the bottom-up, with sound empirically-based microfoundations. We present the foundations of Agent-Based macroeconomics and we discuss how the contributions of this special issue push its frontier forward. Finally, we conclude by discussing the ways ahead for the fully acknowledgement of agent-based models as the standard way of theorizing in macroeconomics.},

As one of the main results, the Gini Index for the Southern Region was larger than the Brazilian one. The most significant portions of income for the reduction of income concentration were those from private sector employees and pensions up to a minimum wage. The one that most contributed to the increase in the concentration of income, both in the South and in Brazil, was the one referring to the income of the employers.},

  abstract = {The first paper by Lotfi A. Zadeh on fuzzy sets appeared 50 years ago. On the occasion of this anniversary, the authors of this report have been led to contribute a series of papers in relation with this event. The report gathers 8 papers, and thus covers many issues in relation with fuzzy sets. The first two provide overviews about the historical emergence of fuzzy sets, and the first steps of the fuzzy set research in France. The third one discusses the scientific legacy of fuzzy sets after 50 years. The next two survey some developments of possibility theory, focusing on two specific issues: the elicitation of qualitative or quantitative possibility distributions, and the forms of inconsistency representable in a possibilistic logic setting. The 6th paper (with Davide Ciucci) surveys the different forms of hybridation between fuzzy set and rough set theories using squares and cubes of opposition. The 7th paper discusses granular computing from different theoretical viewpoints including extensional fuzzy sets, formal concept analysis and rough sets. The last paper (with James C. Bezdek) presents a selected, annotated bibliography of fuzzy set contributions based on representative papers chosen by IEEE CIS Fuzzy Systems pioneers.},

  abstract = {Recent theoretical models of credit rationing suggest that mortgages are rationed with nonprice terms on the basis of default risk despite the development of secondary mortgage markets and the deregulation of deposit rates. We test this hypothesis using aggregate time series data on FHA and conventional mortgage originations. FHA loans are more expensive for borrowers but provide federal guarantees which protect lenders against default losses. For this reason, FHA loans should be subject to easier credit constraints than conventional mortgages, and the FHA share of mortgage originations should increase with aggregate default risk. Default risk is proxied by a bond rate quality spread consistent with previous studies. Our results imply that default risk-induced mortgage rationing persists in the post disintermediation era, but that FHA programs help offset the overall impact of rationing on housing markets.},

We suggest that the definition for the user costs of housing should be extended by an additional term which mirrors the credit constraints a household would be faced with. This extension term consists of the inflation gap between consumer and house price inflation multiplied by an average loan-to-value ratio and the real house prices. The empirical relevance of our finding is confirmed by a VECM. We provide evidence that the dynamics of residential investment in Germany are significantly influenced by the extended user costs (i.e. basic user costs plus the extension term) as well as by net financial wealth. A time series for the user costs of housing is calculated using this extended definition.},

  abstract = {Abstract Single necessary (but not sufficient) conditions are critically important for business theory and practice. Without them, the outcomes cannot occur, and other conditions cannot compensate for this absence. Currently two analytical approaches are available for identifying single necessary conditions: Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA), which was recently developed, and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), which is a more established approach. FsQCA normally focuses on sufficient but not necessary configurations, but can also identify necessary but not sufficient conditions. This study uses NCA to analyze two examples of empirical datasets published in the Journal of Business Research that use fsQCA to identify single necessary conditions. A comparison of the results of NCA and fsQCA shows that NCA can identify more necessary conditions than fsQCA and can specify the level of the condition that is required for a given level of the outcome.},

It argues that using these models can help heterodox researchers to communicate with mainstream economists and might help to further one's personal academic career, but that such a strategy comes along with the risk of having to accept other, very questionable policy conclusions and of stabilizing the use of the DSGE models in mainstream economics, hence potentially delaying a Kuhnean-type `scientific revolution' in macroeconomics.},

Traditional data analyses approaches (e.g., correlation or multiple regression) are not appropriate for testing or inducing such statements. This article proposes necessary condition analysis (NCA) as a general and straightforward methodology for identifying necessary conditions in data sets. The article presents the logic and methodology of necessary but not sufficient contributions of organizational determinants (e.g., events, characteristics, resources, efforts) to a desired outcome (e.g., good performance). A necessary determinant must be present for achieving an outcome, but its presence is not sufficient to obtain that outcome. Without the necessary condition, there is guaranteed failure, which cannot be compensated by other determinants of the outcome. This logic and its related methodology are fundamentally different from the traditional sufficiency-based logic and methodology. Practical recommendations and free software are offered to support researchers to apply NCA.},

  abstract = {The main objective of the qualitative comparative analysis is to find solutions that display sufficient configurations of causal conditions leading to the presence of an outcome. These solutions should be less complex than the original observed configurations, as parsimonious as possible, without sacrificing the sufficiency requirement. Sufficiency and parsimony are two requirements that act in opposition, and an optimal solution is one that accommodates both. There are different search strategies that lead to different types of solutions, with an ongoing debate about which solution type is closest to the true, underlying causal structure. This article presents the different logics behind each simplification system in order to explain how and why they lead to different results and introduces the concept of ``robust sufficiency'' to clear the debate. It analyses the correctness ratios for the different solution type and provides an improved set of procedures to measure correctness that captures the best features from each system. Out of the competition between the conservative and the parsimonious search strategies, the intermediate solution emerges as the best hybrid that is suitable for causal analysis, outperforming the parsimonious solution in recovering a known (even parsimonious) causal structure.},

  abstract = {It has long been argued that an increase in inequality increases the rate of economic growth by increasing the share of income going to profit recipients, whose saving contributes to capital accumulation, so that growth is profit-led. A more recent tradition argues that an increase in equality and a rise in the wage share can increase growth by increasing consumption and investment demand, so that growth is wage-led. Bhaduri and Marglin and others argue, however, that even if economic activity is demand-determined, a shift in income distribution towards profits can increase output and growth. This paper examines how a reduction in inequality affects economic growth, thereby contributing to the debate on wage-led and profit-led growth and broadening it to focus on inequality rather than the profit share. It does so by reviewing and re-examining the cases in which workers save, the determinants of investment, and the open economy, three issues that have been emphasized in the literature.},

  abstract = {This paper extends a Steindlian model of growth and income distribution to incorporate borrowing by consumers. It shows that borrowing by consumers can improve growth prospects in the short run by increasing consumer demand. However, in the longer run the effects of increasing consumer borrowing are ambiguous because, by increasing consumer debt, it redistributes income towards the rich who have a higher propensity to save, thereby possibly depressing aggregate demand and growth despite the borrowing-induced expansion. The problem may be exacerbated by financial considerations involving the increase of the interest rate due to greater borrowing, but these considerations are not necessary for it. The problem is more likely to occur when autonomous investment demand is weak, i.e. when borrowing-induced consumption increases are most required to counter tendencies towards stagnation.},

First, a general framework for examining growth and distribution is discussed, in terms of which classical-Marxian and post-Keynesian\textendash Kaleckian and other theories are presented. Since this framework examines how variables are determined in equilibrium, second, dynamics behind equilibria are examined, focusing on goods market and labor market changes. Third, the framework is extended in a variety of ways to examine additional models addressing productivity growth and technical change, money and inflation, finance and debt, additional distributional considerations, multisector issues, open economy questions, and the environment. It is concluded that the literature on heterodox theories of growth and distribution is vibrant, large, and growing, and addresses many issues that are ignored or neglected in orthodox theories, including power, unemployment, and aggregate demand.},

  abstract = {The global financial crisis led to a crisis in mainstream macroeconomic theory and to questioning the economic policies implemented before and after the crisis. One of the most relevant controversy concerns the role of fiscal policy. In order to present a different theoretical approach and discuss the role of fiscal policy, in this paper, we present an agent based micro-macro multisectoral model to analyze the fiscal policy in a complex evolutionary economy. We evaluate the impact of a set of different fiscal rules in terms of short run fluctuations and long-term growth. The main motivations are both to influence the public debate and to present an important theoretical tool. In terms of economic policy debate, in particular, we analyze the impact of the approval of a new fiscal rule that prevents any real growth of federal public expenditures for at least ten years in Brazil. Based on the simulation model, we compare 5 different combinations of fiscal policy on how they affect macro variables, such as GDP growth rate, GDP volatility and likelihood of crisis. We also test how each fiscal policy combination reacts to an external crisis. Results show that all scenarios that impose a tighter constraint to government spending present signs of self-defeating fiscal consolidation, including effect on firms' indebtedness. On the other hand, unconstrained countercyclical policy prevents contagious effect of external crisis, leading to a better economic performance and reducing the likelihood of crisis.},

We consider two main sources of inefficiency: underdiversification (``down'') and nonparticipation in risky asset markets (``out''). While a few households are very poorly diversified, most Swedish households outperform the Sharpe ratio of their domestic stock index through international diversification. Financially sophisticated households invest more efficiently but also more aggressively, and overall they incur higher return losses from underdiversification. The return cost of nonparticipation is smaller by almost one-half when we take account of the fact that nonparticipants would likely be inefficient investors.},

Platforms sell broadband Internet access services to residential consumers and may set fees to content and application providers on the Internet. When access is monopolized, cross-group externalities (network effects) can give a rationale for network neutrality regulation (requiring zero fees to content providers): there exist parameter ranges for which network neutrality regulation increases the total surplus compared to the fully private optimum at which the monopoly platform imposes positive fees on content providers. However, for other parameter values, network neutrality regulation can decrease total surplus. Extending the model to a duopoly of residential broadband ISPs, we again find parameter values such that network neutrality regulation increases total surplus suggesting that network neutrality regulation could be warranted even when some competition is present. \'O 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Like differential saving rates, differential rates of return matter for post Keynesian theory, because they impact the income and wealth distribution and add an explosive element to growth models. We show that differential rates of return matter empirically by merging data on household balance sheets with long-run returns for individual asset categories. We find that (a) the composition of wealth differentiates three socioeconomic groups: 30\% are asset-poor, 65\% are middle-class home owners, and the top 5\% are business-owning capitalists; (b) rates of return rise across all groups; and (c) rates of return broadly follow a log-shaped function across the distribution, where inequality in the lower half of the distribution is higher than in the upper half. If socioeconomic groups are collapsed into the bottom 95\% workers and top 5\% capitalists, then rates of return are 5.6\% for the former and 7.2\% for the latter.},

  abstract = {US net capital inflows drive the international synchronization of house price growth. An increase (decrease) in US net capital inflows improves (tightens) US dollar funding conditions for non-US global banks, leading them to increase (decrease) foreign lending to third-party borrowing countries. This induces a synchronization of lending across borrowing countries, which translates into an international synchronization of mortgage credit growth and, ultimately, house price growth. Importantly, this synchronization is driven by non-US global banks' common but heterogenous exposure to US dollar funding conditions, not by the common exposure of borrowing countries to non-US global banks. Our results identify a novel channel of international transmission of US dollar funding conditions: As these conditions vary over time, borrowing country pairs whose non-US global creditor banks are more dependent on US dollar funding exhibit higher house price synchronization.},

  abstract = {The relationship between co-integration and error correction models, first suggested in Granger (1981), is here extended and used to develop estimation procedures, tests, and empirical examples. If each element of a vector of time series x\textsubscript{t} first achieves stationarity after differencing, but a linear combination {$<$}tex-math{$>\$\backslash$}alpha \^\{\textbackslash prime \}x\_\{t\}\${$<$}/tex-math{$>$} is already stationary, the time series x\textsubscript{t} are said to be co-integrated with co-integrating vector {$\alpha$}. There may be several such co-integrating vectors so that {$\alpha$} becomes a matrix. Interpreting {$<$}tex-math{$>\$\backslash$}alpha \^\{\textbackslash prime \}x\_\{t\}=0\${$<$}/tex-math{$>$} as a long run equilibrium, co-integration implies that deviations from equilibrium are stationary, with finite variance, even though the series themselves are nonstationary and have infinite variance. The paper presents a representation theorem based on Granger (1983), which connects the moving average, autoregressive, and error correction representations for co-integrated systems. A vector autoregression in differenced variables is incompatible with these representations. Estimation of these models is discussed and a simple but asymptotically efficient two-step estimator is proposed. Testing for co-integration combines the problems of unit root tests and tests with parameters unidentified under the null. Seven statistics are formulated and analyzed. The critical values of these statistics are calculated based on a Monte Carlo simulation. Using these critical values, the power properties of the tests are examined and one test procedure is recommended for application. In a series of examples it is found that consumption and income are co-integrated, wages and prices are not, short and long interest rates are, and nominal GNP is co-integrated with M2, but not M1, M3, or aggregate liquid assets.},

The model is characterized by four types of agents: households, firms, banks and a central bank, which interact through different types of markets: a consumption goods market, a labor market, a housing market and a credit market. We model a wealth effect of housing wealth into households consumption budget as the main link between the housing market and the real economy. Banks will extend mortgages to households only if the expenditure on housing, as a proportion of total income, is lower than a given threshold ({$\beta$}). Different simulations are preformed to see how changing {$\beta$}effects the housing market and the real economy. We find that by lowering the constraint on bank lending, i.e. increasing {$\beta$}, housing prices boom, positively affecting the real economy},

  abstract = {Housing markets are inherently spatial, yet many existing models fail to capture this spatial dimension. Here we introduce a new graph-based approach for incorporating a spatial component in a large-scale urban housing agent-based model (ABM). The model explicitly captures several social and economic factors that influence the agents' decision-making behaviour (such as fear of missing out, their trend following aptitude, and the strength of their submarket outreach), and interprets these factors in spatial terms. The proposed model is calibrated and validated with the housing market data for the Greater Sydney region. The ABM simulation results not only include predictions for the overall market, but also produce area-specific forecasting at the level of local government areas within Sydney. In addition, the simulation results elucidate movement patterns across submarkets, in both spatial and homeownership terms, including renters, first-time home buyers, as well as local and overseas investors.},

We argue that these dimensions affect the way in which empirical validation is carried out by AB modelers and we critically discuss the main alternative approaches to empirical validation being developed in AB economics.

  abstract = {The paper presents a model of endogenous growth in which firms are modeled as boundedly-rational, locally interacting, agents. Firms produce a homogeneous good employing technologies located in an open-ended technological space and are allowed to either imitate existing similar practices or to locally explore the technological space to find new, more productive, techniques. We first identify sufficient conditions for the emergence of empirically plausible GDP time-series characterized by self-sustained growth. Then, we study the trade-off between individual rationality and collective outcomes by providing an example in which more rational agents systematically perform worse than less rational ones.},

  abstract = {Since the survey by Windrum et al. (Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation 10:8, 2007), research on empirical validation of agent-based models in economics has made substantial advances, thanks to a constant flow of high-quality contributions. This Chapter attempts to take stock of such recent literature to offer an updated critical review of the existing validation techniques. We sketch a simple theoretical framework that conceptualizes existing validation approaches, which we examine along three different dimensions: (i) comparison between artificial and real-world data; (ii) calibration and estimation of model parameters; and (iii) parameter space exploration. Finally, we discuss open issues in the field of ABM validation and estimation. In particular, we argue that more research efforts should be devoted toward advancing hypothesis testing in ABM, with specific emphasis on model stationarity and ergodicity.},

  abstract = {A recent literature incorporates autonomous non-capacity creating expenditures in a medium-run and a longrun Kaleckian growth models. We analyze this literature from the perspective of the Sraffian Supermultiplier model. From this point of view, traditional Kaleckian growth models have three important limitations: they cannot generate a tendency towards normal capacity utilization; they do not imply a positive relationship between the rate of output growth and the investment-output ratio; and they fail to give a growth-determining role to autonomous non-capacity creating expenditures in the interpretation of real demand-led growth processes. The medium-run model cannot completely overcome all these three limitations and can generate implausible behavior under certain conditions. The long-run model can overcome all three limitations because it combines an investment function based on the capital stock adjustment principle with an endogenous determination of the saving ratio that does not resort to changes in income distribution. Moreover, we argue that an analysis based on the Harrodian instability principle cannot be properly used in the investigation of the stability condition of the Supermultiplier equilibrium of the long-run model. Instead, we suggest that the stability condition of such an equilibrium should be interpreted as a generalized Keynesian stability condition, according to which the propensity to spend should have a value lower than one throughout the whole disequilibrium path of the model.},

  abstract = {Most empirical models of investment rely on the assumption that firms are able to respond to prices set in centralized securities markets (through the "cost of capital" or "q"). An alternative approach emphasizes the importance of cash flow as a determinant of investment spending, because of a "financing hierarchy," in which internal finance has important cost advantages over external finance. We build on recent research concerning imperfections in markets for equity and debt. This work suggests that some firms do not have sufficient access to external capital markets to enable them to respond to changes in the cost of capital, asset prices, or tax-based investment incentives. To the extent that firms are constrained in their ability to raise funds externally, investment spending may be sensitive to the availability of internal finance. That is, investment may display "excess sensitivity" to movements in cash flow. In this paper, we work within the q theory of investment, and examine the importance of a financing hierarchy created by capital-market imperfections. Using panel data on individual manufacturing firms, we compare the investment behavior of rapidly growing firms that exhaust all of their internal finance with that of mature firms paying dividends. We find that q values remain very high for significant periods of time for firms paying no dividends, relative to those for mature firms. We also find that investment is more sensitive to cash flow for the group of firms that our model implies is most likely to face external finance constraints. These results are consistent with the augmented model we propose, which takes into account different financing regimes for different groups of firms. Some extensions and implications for public policy are discussed at the end.},

Este desempenho \'e analisado por meio de um modelo de crescimento de causa\c{c}\~ao cumulativa liderado pela demanda de influ\^encia kaleckiana e kaldoriana que integra distribui\c{c}\~ao de renda, demanda e produtividade do trabalho em perspectiva setorial. O objetivo do trabalho \'e analisar os impactos cumulativos do crescimento do sal\'ario real sobre o crescimento da demanda e produtividade do trabalho durante o per\'iodo entre 2004 a 2013 na economia brasileira. Um modelo econom\'etrico de dados em painel \'e utilizado, baseado, dentre outras fontes, em dados da matriz insumo-produto brasileira. A presen\c{c}a de endogeneidade nas vari\'aveis do modelo \'e tratada pelo m\'etodo dos momentos generalizados. Os resultados mostram que o crescimento da demanda no per\'iodo foi liderado pelo aumento da parcela salarial. O efeito Verdoorn indica que a expans\~ao da demanda elevou o crescimento da produtividade do trabalho. Por sua vez, a produtividade n\~ao foi afetada diretamente pelo crescimento do sal\'ario real, de modo que o efeito Hicks-Marx foi nulo. O crescimento dos sal\'arios foi fundamental para a expans\~ao da demanda. Contudo, n\~ao houve uma mudan\c{c}a estrutural robusta. Os setores que mais contribu\'iram para o crescimento dos sal\'arios, produto e emprego foram \`aqueles com os menores n\'iveis de produtividade do trabalho. Por isso, o aumento da demanda e sal\'arios pouco afetou o crescimento da produtividade, embora tenha elevado \`a parcela salarial, reduzido a desigualdade salarial e gerado significativo volume de emprego. O crescimento econ\^omico elevado e sustentado com redistribui\c{c}\~ao de renda requer uma mudan\c{c}a estrutural na economia para deslocar o emprego e aumentar o investimento em dire\c{c}\~ao \`as atividades com retornos crescentes, como o setor manufatureiro inovador},

  abstract = {This article reviews recent advances in fixed effect estimation of panel data models for long panels, where the number of time periods is relatively large. We focus on semiparametric models with unobserved individual and time effects, where the distribution of the outcome variable conditional on covariates and unobserved effects is specified parametrically, while the distribution of the unobserved effects is left unrestricted. Compared to existing reviews on long panels (Arellano and Hahn 2007; a section in Arellano and Bonhomme 2011) we discuss models with both individual and time effects, split-panel Jackknife bias corrections, unbalanced panels, distribution and quantile effects, and other extensions. Understanding and correcting the incidental parameter bias caused by the estimation of many fixed effects is our main focus, and the unifying theme is that the order of this bias is given by the simple formula p/n for all models discussed, with p the number of estimated parameters and n the total sample size.},

  abstract = {The 2007 sub-prime crisis in the United States, prolonged by a severe economic recession spread over many countries around the world, has led many researchers to focus on the recent fluctuations in housing prices and their relationships with macroeconomics and monetary policies. The existence of common housing cycles among the countries of the euro zone could lead the European Central Bank to integrate more specifically the evolution of such asset prices in its assessment. In this paper, we implement a multivariate unobserved component model on housing market variables in order to assess the common euro area housing cycle and to evaluate its relationship with the economic cycle. Among the general class of multivariate unobserved component models, we implement the band-pass filter based on the trend plus cycle decomposition model and we allow the existence of two cycles of different periods. The dataset consists of gross domestic product and real house prices series for four main euro area countries (Germany, France, Italy and Spain). Empirical results show a strong relationship for business cycles in France, Italy and Spain. Moreover, French and Spanish house prices cycles appear to be strongly related, while the German one possesses its own dynamics. Finally, we find that GDP and house prices cycles are related in the medium-term for fluctuations between 4 and 8 years, while the housing market contributes to the long-termeconomic growth only in Spain and Germany},

In a first part, we empirically show that cycles in the housing sector, measured by housing prices, housing starts, building permits, sales or residential investment, are strongly correlated to GDP cycles with a lead lying between of one and four quarters, suggesting thus that a monitoring of housing fluctuations could bring useful information for macroeconomic forecasting. Interestingly, this result is robust to the various considered approaches. Moreover, it seems that the housing sector long-term trend possesses its own dynamics, quite different from the aggregate French economic activity. Thus, in a second part, we review various structural factors that could drive housing market developments in France in the future.},

  abstract = {{$<$}section class="abstract"{$><$}p{$>$}As is well known, the closure of the canonical Neo-Kaleckian model is an endogenous rate of capacity utilisation. To allay concerns of Harrodian instability one response has been to endogenise the normal rate to effective demand pressures. Recent contributions have stressed microfoundations for an adjustment in the normal rate towards the actual rate. The new approach focuses on shiftwork and redefines capacity utilisation as the average workweek of capital. This paper examines whether the new concept of capacity utilisation can provide a firmer basis for endogeneity in the normal rate. It argues that the assumption of variability in the normal shift system cannot be generalised across manufacturing industries, while the potential relevance for non-manufacturing industries is unknown. Another concern is that long-run trends in the average workweek of capital and aggregate demand do not coincide. The paper also finds that the long-run trend in the US Federal Reserve's index of capacity utilisation for the manufacturing sector is not flat as frequently claimed. Instead, there is a downward trend from the mid 1960s, which matches the slowdown in aggregate demand.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {This paper reviews various interpretations of the nature and effects of financialization, suggesting that finance has expanded disproportionately, with correspondingly negative effects on the volume and the efficiency of capital accumulation and causing dysfunction in economic and social reproduction, accordingly as finance incorporates a wider range of economic and social activities. This is important in order to understand the relatively slow growth since the end of the post-war boom and the causes and course of the current crisis. The close relationship between financialization and neoliberalism is emphasised, the latter having gone through a shock phase (of state intervention intended to promote private capital in general and finance in particular), followed by further intervention to sustain financialization and respond to its dysfunctions. Consequently, it is important to distinguish between the often inconsistent and shifting incidence of scholarship, ideology and policy in practice that characterises neoliberalism. Alternative strategies will need to go beyond financialization to the material conditions of production and reproduction themselves.},

On the one hand, the study of multiple configurational causal relations allows researchers to deal with the extremely complex set of elements that interact in policy processes. However, this task poses the challenge of balancing deductive and inductive logics in a research design. On the other hand, policy process theories often involve temporal arguments, but QCA does not easily deal with dynamic elements. This article discusses these challenges and proposes several ways to address them. It thereby illustrates the advantages and limitations of QCA for students of policy processes.},

In countries where taxes are a politically costly alternative to generate fiscal revenue, debt finances fiscal expansionary activity to initially raise wages and increase output. However, institutional mechanisms keep such drivers in check, and prompt a stop-and-go cycle as Kalecki suggested in his landmark 1943 paper. We find that the push of labor interests against business stakeholders leads to nonlinear dynamics over debt and deficits and creates uncertainty over long-term growth path.},

Growing income inequality in the United States means those at the top bid up the price of valued goods like housing and those in lower groups have struggled to maintain their relative positions. We explore this process in the context of the U.S. housing market from 1999 to 2007 by analyzing over 4,000 residential moves from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Houses are the ultimate status symbol. Their size, quality, and location signal to others that one has (or has not) arrived. We show that in areas where income inequality was higher, all movers went deeper into debt and increased their monthly housing costs to live in more desirable neighborhoods. But because people at the top of the income distribution had so much more money, they were able to take on less debt to keep their position in the status queue. Everyone below them who made a move to buy a house took on more debt, particularly in areas with higher income inequality. This evidence suggests that growing inequality implies that those at the top buy the best homes while others struggle to keep pace amid rising housing costs.},

Regional myocardial blood flow was determined by means of the particle distribution method. In normoxia a transmural gradient of flow was observed, with the subendocardial layers receiving a significantly higher flow rate compared with the subepicardial layers. In hypoxia induced vasodilation this transmural gradient of flow was persistent. In contrast a marked redistribution of regional flow was observed under pharmacologically induced vasodilation. The transmural gradient decreased. In contrast to some findings these experiments demonstrate that a considerable vasodilatory capacity exists in all layers of the myocardium and can be utilized by drugs. The differences observed for the intramural distribution pattern of flow under hypoxia and drug induced vasodilation support the hypothesis that this pattern reflects corresponding gradients of regional myocardial metabolism.},

We show that such a reallocation never occurred, as the distribution of mortgage debt with respect to income changed little even as the aggregate stock of debt grew rapidly. Moreover, because mortgage debt varies positively with income in the cross section, equal percentage increases in debt among high- and low-income borrowers meant that wealthy borrowers accounted for most new debt in dollar terms. Previous research stressing the importance of low-income borrowing was based on the inflow of new mortgage originations alone, so it could not detect offsetting outflows in mortgage terminations that left the allocation of debt stable over time. And while defaults on subprime mortgages played an important part in the financial crisis, the data show that subprime lending did not cause a reallocation of debt toward the poor. Rather, subprime lending prevented a reallocation of debt toward the wealthy.},

Reformulating their discrete-time model in a way that makes the length of the adjustment period explicit, it aks whether two elementary postulates of a sound modelling are satisfied: (a) A model should also remain well-defined when the adjustment period shrinks to zero; (b) The main qualitative dynamic properties should not essentially be affected by the choice of the adjustment period. It is found that postulate (a) is fulfilled but, regarding the presence of cyclical dynamics, postulate (b) is violated. In addition, the stability condition in the continuous-time version has an unsatisfactory economic implication. On the other hand, a rival supermultiplier model (specified along the lines proposed by, in particular, Allain and Lavoie) is spared from these problems. This suggests that the problem in SFB is caused by too strong an accelerator mechanism.},

Invoking a strategic complementarity, desired utilization is thus an increasing function of not only the profit share but also the actual utilization. Drawing on recent empirical material and a straightforward functional specification, the model is subsequently numerically calibrated. In particular, this ensures a unique solution for a steady-state position in which the actual and the endogenous desired rates of utilization coincide. On the other hand, it turns out that the anticipated losses of firms by not producing at the desired level are rather small. Hence there may be only weak pressure on them to close a utilization gap in the ordinary way by suitable adjustments in fixed investment. It is indicated that this finding may serve Kaleckian economists as a more rigorous justification for viewing their equilibria as pertaining to the long run, even if they allow actual utilization to deviate persistently from desired utilization.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a simple but complete formal version of the Sraffian supermultiplier model in which (i) growth is led by the autonomous components of demand that do not create capacity; (ii) private productive investment is an induced expenditure; and (iii) income distribution is exogenous. We show that the main results of the long-period and fully adjusted versions of the model in terms of growth rate and level effects are quite similar and therefore that such results in no way require the full adjustment of capacity to demand. We then analyze a simple set of sufficient dynamic local stability conditions that allow the long-period positions to gravitate towards the fully adjusted position in which capacity is adjusted to demand and that also provide the upper limit to demand-led growth paths. Finally, we show how some critics of the model have misinterpreted it as being supply-led and how this has led to a further confusion between the analysis of the tendency towards a constant value of the capacity-saving-determined warranted rate of growth and the proper stability analysis of the opposite process of adjusting capacity to demand (which tends to adjust the warranted rate endogenously to the growth rate of autonomous demand).},

The analysis of the impacts of changes in the interest rate is conducted according to two possible closures for the Classical/Sraffian theory of income distribution. In the first closure the changes in the rate of interest do not affect income distribution between wages and profits, which implies that its influence over the endogenous variables operates only through the financial component of total government deficit. The second closure is the monetary theory of distribution according to which there is an inverse relationship between the rate of interest and the wage share. In this case, besides the pure financial effect, we show that the change in the rate of interest affects the economy through the equilibrium value of the supermultiplier and the tax burden. The analysis is carried out both for the case in which the interest rate is lower than the trend rate of growth of output as well as for the opposite case.},

However, the study of wealth, which is more unequally distributed than income, has been largely understudied within CPE. Using new data from the World Income Database (WID), this article examines how economic, political and institutional dynamics shape wealth-to-income ratios within Western European and OECD countries. It is found that the political and institutional determinants that affect income inequality have no short- or long-run effects on the wealth-to-income ratio. Rather, the rise in wealth-to-income ratios is driven by rising housing prices, as well as price changes in other financial assets, not home ownership or national saving rates.

For half of the covered countries, projected increases in house prices are large enough to outpace real incomes, thereby further eroding housing affordability. The paper illustrates and quantifies how housing policies can make a difference. Removing mortgage interest relief eases price pressures and can contribute to more affordable housing. Likewise, streamlining land-use governance and easing rental control can help unlock housing supply, make housing markets more efficient and, ultimately, housing more affordable.},

Paradoxically, the fuzzy set is a powerful tool because it replaces an unwieldy, "fuzzy" instrument\textemdash the variable, which establishes only the positions of cases relative to each other, with a precise one\textemdash degree of membership in a well-defined set.Ragin argues that fuzzy sets allow a far richer dialogue between ideas and evidence in social research than previously possible. They let quantitative researchers abandon "homogenizing assumptions" about cases and causes, they extend diversity-oriented research strategies, and they provide a powerful connection between theory and data analysis. Most important, fuzzy sets can be carefully tailored to fit evolving theoretical concepts, sharpening quantitative tools with in-depth knowledge gained through qualitative, case-oriented inquiry. This book will revolutionize research methods not only in sociology, political science, and anthropology but in any field of inquiry dealing with complex patterns of causation.},

Although both models' empirical predictions in the short-run are confirmed, our results reject the baseline Neo-Kaleckian model in favor of the Sraffian Supermultiplier in the long-run .},

  abstract = {Many in the housing literature argue that house prices and income are cointegrated. I show that the data do not support this view. Standard tests using 27 years of national-level data do not find evidence of cointegration. However, standard tests for cointegration have low power, especially in small samples. I use panel-data tests for cointegration that are more powerful than their time-series counterparts to test for cointegration in a panel of 95 metro areas over 23 years. Using a bootstrap approach to allow for cross-correlations in city-level house-price shocks, I show that even these more powerful tests do not reject the hypothesis of no cointegration. Thus the error-correction specification for house prices and income commonly found in the literature may be inappropriate.},

Using a quasi-natural experiment wherein investors purchased pre-packaged distressed home portfolios from the government-sponsored enterprises, we find that properties located within 0.25 miles of bulk-sold properties sell for 1.4\% more than homes located farther away. This spillover effect is greater for foreclosed homes (4.3\%), homes that are similar to the bulk-sold homes (2.5\%), and homes in highly distressed neighborhoods (7.4\%). Our results highlight asset disposition through pooling and institutional participation as a potential market-driven channel for the recovery of distressed housing markets.},

In economics the industrial dynamics approach makes use of simulation techniques to understand the complexity of the industrial process of continuous change. Among these models, a new branch of studies known as ``History-friendly'' models aims at establishing a close link between formal theory, developing stand-alone theoretical simulation models, and empirical evidence. In this paper, we study ``History-friendly'' analyses and counterfactuals. Some examples of ``History-friendly'' models are widely examined. Finally, the paper makes a critical contribution to ``History-friendly'' methodology and defines the role of ``History-friendly'' models in the debate on the empirical validation of simulations.},

  abstract = {Before economists relegate a speculative event to the inexplicable or bubble category, we must exhaust all reasonable economic explanations. Among the "reasonable" or "market fundamental" explanations I would include the perception of an increased probability of large returns. The perception might be triggered by genuine economic good news, by a convincing new economic theory about payoffs, or by a fraud launched by insiders acting strategically to trick investors. It might also be triggered by uninformed market participants correctly inferring changes in the distribution of dividends by observing price movements generated by the trading of informed insiders. While some of these perceptions might in the end prove erroneous, movements in asset prices based on them are fundamental and not bubble movements. I aim in these pages to propose market fundamental explanations for the three most famous bubbles: the Dutch tulipmania (1634-37), the Mississippi Bubble (1719-20), and the closely connected South Sea Bubble (1720). Though several authors have proposed market fundamental explanations for the well-documented Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles, these episodes are still treated in the modern literature as outbursts of irrationality.},

Building from complexity theory and configurational analysis, this study offers clarity to inconclusive previous empirical results about the link among several board features and firm financial performance. From a sample of 295 non-financial firms from Southern Europe for the period 2001-2010, and by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, findings of this study show that firm financial performance depends on a complex configuration of several board features (board size, board independence, leadership structure and board activity) and several corporate characteristics (firm size, firm leverage and firm age). This paper has implications for academics. Despite different theoretical arguments and inconclusive results of the wide empirical literature addressing the effect of board characteristics on the firm performance, building from complexity theory this paper adds to our knowledge because it empirically explores under which circumstances different board features should contribute positively or negatively to firm performance. The results of this study have also implications for policy makers and practitioners by providing some useful hints to the controversial relationship between corporate governance and financial performance. In this sense, general corporate governance recommendations must be rethought.},

It shows that given two simple hypotheses, the economy will exhibit a tendency to grow independently of any increase in the average level of ongoing investment (or any other type of `autonomous' demand) over time. The two hypotheses are (a) that investment oscillates over time and (b) that the community's marginal propensity to consume is lower when income contracts in slumps than when it increases in booms. This points to a source of growth that is as endogenous to the system, as trade cycles are.},

  author = {G{\"a}rtner, Katharina},
  pages = {45},
  abstract = {This paper tracks the history of government intervention in the U.S. mortgage market between 1932 and the 1960s, a period in which the system for housing finance underwent a fundamental transformation. Whereas prior to 1930 the government had little involvement in the mortgage market, by the 1960s it was a major player. These interventions were triggered in part by economic crises, particularly the Great Depression. Yet, as I argue in this paper, they were also motivated by a cultural understanding of homeownership as central to American identity and the rise of housing policy as a substitute for other forms of social assistance. Many of the instruments established during these years to direct the flow of credit toward housing would emerge as central features of the housing market that persist to the present day. These policies mark the beginning of the permanent subsidisation of residential mortgage credit. In addition, beyond introducing long-term debt instruments to the consumer, they fostered the depersonalisation of credit relations. In this way, I also show that some of the weaknesses that have contributed to current U.S. housing market woes found their inception in the policy responses to the Great Depression.},

  abstract = {This paper will explore the effects of errors in floating point arithmetic in two published agent-based models: the first a model of land use change (Polhill et al. 2001; Gotts et al. 2003), the second a model of the stock market (LeBaron et al. 1999). The first example demonstrates how branching statements with floating point operands of comparison operators create a high degree of nonlinearity, leading in this case to the creation of 'ghost' agents -- visible to some parts of the program but not to others. A potential solution to this problem is proposed. The second example shows how mathematical descriptions of models in the literature are insufficient to enable exact replication of work since mathematically equivalent implementations in terms of real number arithmetic are not equivalent in terms of floating point arithmetic.},

  abstract = {House prices in many advanced economies have risen substantially in recent decades. But experience indicates that housing prices can diverge from their long-run equilibrium or sustainable levels, potentially followed by adjustments that impact macroeconomic and financial stability. Therefore there is a need to monitor house prices and assess whether they are sustainable. This paper focuses on fundamentals expected to drive long-run trends in house prices, including institutional and structural factors. The scale of potential valuation gaps is gauged on the basis of a cross-country panel analysis of house prices in 20 OECD countries.},

Aware of the complex mechanism to trace possible causes for such a variation, this study uses qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to test the influence of nine international and domestic factors in influencing this process in 20 out of 29 post-communist countries. The evidence indicates that, out of all considered potential explanations, the perspective of the EU accession and a constant economic development are the primary propellers that induce democratization in the region. These quantitative results support and complement the literature that emphasizes the increased role played by the EU promise in the democratization process of the region.},

Using panel data on 20 OECD countries, we show that the rate of growth of autonomous demand (exports, public spending, and housing investment) is positively correlated with subsequent values of the share of business investment in GDP. By means of an instrumental-variables (IV) strategy, we confirm a positive effect of demand dynamics on the business investment share. We instrument autonomous demand with (i) US demand for imports interacted with exposure to trade with the US, (ii) openness to trade of a country's main export destinations, and (iii) military spending. A permanent 1-percentage-point increase in autonomous-demand growth raises the investment share by 1.5 to 1.9 percentage points of GDP in our preferred panel IV specification. Our results provide empirical support for the view that the influence of aggregate demand on capital accumulation can be a major source of hysteresis. Our results are inconsistent with the canonical New Keynesian three-equations model, the Neo-Kaleckian model with flexible equilibrium utilization, and Classical\textendash Marxian growth models.

  abstract = {According to the Sraffian supermultiplier model, economic growth is driven by the autonomous components of aggregate demand (exports, public spending and autonomous consumption). This paper tests empirically some major implications of the model. For this purpose, we calculate time-series of the autonomous components of aggregate demand and of the supermultiplier for the US, France, Germany, Italy and Spain and describe their patterns in recent decades. We observe that changes in output and in autonomous demand are tightly correlated, both in the long and in the short-run. The supermultiplier is substantially higher and more stable in the US, while in the European countries it is lower and strongly decreasing. Consistently with theory, we find that where the supermultiplier is reasonably stable - i.e., in the US since the 1960s - autonomous demand and output share a common long-run trend (i.e, they are cointegrated). The estimation of a Vector Error-Correction model (VECM) on US data suggests that autonomous demand exerts a long-run effect on GDP, but also that there is simultaneous causality between the two variables. We propose an explanation based on the idea that autonomous demand is socially and historically determined. We then estimate the multiplier of autonomous spending through a panel instrumental-variables approach, finding that a one dollar increase in autonomous demand raises output by 1.6 dollars over four years. A further implication of the model that we test against empirical evidence is that increases in autonomous demand growth tend to be followed by increases in the investment share. Through Granger-causality tests and instrumental variables analysis, we find that this is the case in all five countries. An additional 1\% increase in autonomous demand raises the investment share by 0.57 percentage points of GDP in the long-run},

  abstract = {As well-known, the canonical Neo-Kaleckian growth model fails to reconcile actual and normal rates of utilization in equilibrium. Some recent contributions revive an old proposal for solving this problem \textendash{} making the normal rate of utilization an endogenous variable that converges to the actual utilization rate \textendash{} justifying it with new, micro-founded premises. We argue that these new justifications for the convergence of normal to actual utilization do not stand closer scrutiny. First, the proposed microeconomic model relies on various restrictive assumptions, some of which are mutually inconsistent. Second, the derivation of the macroeconomic adjustment mechanism from the microeconomic analysis involves a logical leap, that can be justified only by a very arbitrary assumption with little economic justification. Finally, we discuss the way in which this mechanism has been incorporated into the Neo-Kaleckian growth model by proposers of this approach. We show that, even if one puts aside, for the sake of argument, the first two points, the existence of autonomous components of demand is sufficient to invalidate the resulting macroeconomic model.},

  abstract = {How do inequality and growth evolve in the long run and why? We address this question by analyzing the interplay between household debt, growth and inequality within a monetary, stock-flow consistent framework. We first consider a Goodwin\textendash Keen model where household consumption, rather than investment by firms, is the key behavioural driver for the dynamics of the economy. Whenever consumption exceeds current income, households can borrow from the banking sector. The resulting three dimensional dynamical system for wage share, employment rate, and household debt exhibits the characteristic asymptotic equilibria of the original Keen model, namely the analogue of Solow's balanced-growth path, where all state variables converge to an interior point, in addition to deflationary equilibria with explosive debt and collapsing employment. We then extend this set-up by separating the household sector into workers and investors, obtaining a four-dimensional system with analogous types of asymptotic behaviour. Our main result is that long-run increasing inequality between these two classes of households occurs if and only if the system approaches one of the equilibria with unbounded debt ratios. More specifically, we find that one essential channel of increased inequality is the wealth transfer from workers to investors due to interest paid on debt from the former to the latter. Finally, when properly rewritten, the celebrated inequality r {$>$} g turns out to be a necessary condition for the asymptotic stability of long-run debt-deflation. Our findings shed new light on the relationships between fairness and efficiency, and have implications for public economic policy.},

It focuses on how differences in the degree of resilience to economic shocks can be affected by the structural and institutional characteristics of housing and mortgage markets. First, there is a brief account of the uneven resilience of the OECD countries to common economic shocks. Second, some stylized facts concerning the interaction between housing markets and the business cycle are examined, attending in particular to how closely home prices and output are associated over the cycle and whether countries differ in this regard. The third section is concerned with the mechanisms linking home prices with consumption, and the wider economy. Finally, there is a comment on the extent to which structural policy factors help account for home-price variability. Controlled Vocabulary Terms business cycle; Housing; Macroeconomics},

Because of the important role housing wealth has been playing during the current upswing, this paper will look more closely at what is underlying these developments for 18 OECD countries over the period from 1970 to the present, with a view to shedding some light on whether or not prices are in line with fundamentals. The paper begins by putting the most recent housing price run-ups in the context of the experiences of the past 35 years. It then examines current valuations against a range of benchmarks. It concludes with a review of the links between a possible correction of housing prices and real activity. The main highlights from this analysis are as follows: 1) The size and duration of the current real house price increases; the degree to which they have tended to move together across countries; and the extent to which they have disconnected from the business cycle are unprecedented. 2) Overvaluation of real house prices may only apply to a relatively small number of countries. However, the extent to which these prices look to be fairly valued depends largely on longer-term interest rates remaining at or close to their current low levels. 3) If house prices were to adjust downward, the historical record suggests that the drops might be large and that the process could be protracted, given the observed stickiness of nominal house prices and the current low rates of inflation.},

We explain why growth at Harrod's warranted rate is fundamentally or statically unstable. We then show how the autonomous demand component in the Sraffian Supermultiplier eliminates Harrodian instability and that the dynamic stability of the supermultiplier depends on the marginal propensity to spend remaining lower than one during the adjustment, a modified ``Keynesian stability'' condition.},

The expansion has been generated by economic processes that are unsustainable--processes in private saving, private borrowing, and asset prices that have fueled the growth of demand against a negative impetus both from fiscal policy and from net export demand. Given unchanged fiscal policy and the consensus forecast for growth in the rest of the world, continued expansion requires that private expenditure continue to expand relative to income on a record and growing scale, and it seems impossible that this source of growth can be forthcoming indefinitely, although it may well continue into next year. When private demand falters, it will be necessary to bring about a substantial relaxation of fiscal policy and to ensure that there is a structural improvement in the United States's balance of payments.},

Accordingly, the main goal of this paper is to investigate how changes in income taxes and personal income distribution affect output growth in the stylized model. The theoretical discussion of the model is then empirically assessed using data retrieved from the Survey of Household Income and Wealth published by the Bank of Italy. The empirical analysis confirms both the heterogeneity of the propensities to consume of Italian households, as well as validates the dominance of absolute income effects in the Italian consumer behaviour that assures the negative trade-off between inequality and aggregate demand. More specifically, it is shown that, overall, Italians are still incomebudget constrained, preventing from a compensation of the demand-depressing effects of raising inequality via debt and wealth-based consumption. Likewise, it is argued that decreasing personal income inequality via progressive income tax reforms and through a shift towards wages would have positive effects on aggregate demand, utilization and growth, further boosting the effect of government expenditure (through its impact on the multiplier).},

  abstract = {This paper develops an amended version of the Sraffian Supermultiplier Model incorporating personal income inequality and income taxes to cover an existing gap in the literature. It is demonstrated that a progressive tax shift would engender temporary higher growth rates (during the traverse) and an overall positive level effect. Furthermore, the size of this impact is associated to the product of the propensity to consume and the income share of each income bracket. Secondly, financial features and real estate prices are incorporated in autonomous consumption. Shifts in the financial parameters, as well as the sustainability of autonomous consumption-led growth are discussed, together with the policy conditions that lead to sustainable growth strategies. In this sense, two issues are highlighted. First, the growth of debt-financed consumption has to move in step rather than detached from income distribution, with debt being stopped from replacing systematically disposable income (leading both to higher levels of output as well as to a more stable multiplier). Second, it is argued that an analysis of growth contributions is of chief importance in terms of policy design and implementation, thus preventing the supremacy of autonomous consumption over other components autonomous demand.},

Goldsmith has combined his experience, good sense, and flair with figures to construct this groundbreaking comparative study of the balance sheets of twenty of the largest nations. A pioneer in the field of national accounts, Goldsmith now presents a work that will be a valuable tool in tracking the economic progress of and between nations. The majority of the balance sheets were created especially for this project, their components gleaned from fragmentary and heterogeneous data. There are approximately 3,500 entries, each measuring the value of one type of tangible or financial asset or liability at a given date. Goldsmith's estimates are keyed to fifteen benchmark dates in the economic progress of the cited nations, and for twelve nations he was able to construct balance sheets dating back to the nineteenth century or earlier. Combined, worldwide balance sheet are included for 1950 and 1978. Comparative National Balance Sheets will provide an essential basis for the quantitative analysis of the long-term financial development of these nations. In addition to national balance sheets for all large countries except Brazil and China, sectoral balance sheets for France, Germany, Great Britain, India, Japan, and the United States in the postwar period are also included.},

  abstract = {The neo-Kaleckian theoretical framework focuses on the importance of effective demand in the income generation process in order to relate its functional distribution \textendash{} share of income that goes to wage and profits \textendash{} to economic growth, and thus characterize the demand regime that leads it, either wage-led (wage share positively affecting growth) or profit led (profit share positively affecting growth). Recent contributions include extensions to the standard model such as open economy effects, family credit, and personal distribution of income to further characterize the regime type. Based on that approach, this paper aims to empirically analyze the performance of the Brazilian economy between 1995 and 2015 in order to identify the relationship between functional distribution of income and aggregate demand. The idea is to test whether variables that are not present in the seminal model that seem to affect the brazillian economy in the 2000s \textendash{} such as consumer credit, personal distribution of income, commodity prices and the share of service sector on GDP \textendash{} alter the relationship between the two variables. Our results suggest that the control for those aspects indeed change the intercept and inclination of our demmand and distributive curves.},

This paper examines how foreign demand affects U.S. housing markets, and uses this demand shock to estimate local price elasticities of supply. Other countries introduced foreign-buyer taxes meant to deter Chinese housing investment beginning in 2011. We first show house prices grew 8 percentage points more in U.S. zipcodes with high foreign-born Chinese populations after 2011, subsequently reversing with the onset of the U.S.\textendash China trade war. Second, we use international tax policy changes as a U.S. housing demand shock and estimate local house price and quantity elasticities with respect to international capital. We find that a 1\% increase in instrumented foreign capital raises house prices at the zip code level by 0.27\%, and housing supply by 0.004\%. Finally, we use the two elasticities to construct new local house price elasticities of supply for the largest 100 CBSAs. These supply elasticities average 0.1 and vary between 0.02 and 0.7, suggesting that local housing markets are inelastic in the short run and exhibit substantial spatial heterogeneity.},

Building upon a considerable library of research on fund returns, the study uses fsQCA to affirm and extend earlier discoveries. Considered here is fund performance relative to Morningstar ratings, features of the funds themselves, as well as characteristics of the fund managers. Results suggest that positive Morningstar and analyst ratings are necessary conditions, on average, for funds to generate value according to the Jensen's alpha ratio. Just over seven percent of the cases imply that funds have attractive Sharpe ratios and higher returns when the funds have lower management fees and lower ongoing fees. Likewise, larger funds with better Morningstar ratings are associated with improved Sharpe ratios and better returns, often where the fund manager has not been managing the fund for a long period.},

Drawing                 both on classic organization design theory and on configurational and                 complementarity-based approaches, the paper specifies a set of basic organizational                 elements and a set of combinatory laws regulating their effective combinations.                 Testable propositions are derived on the necessary and sufficient conditions that                 the composition of organizations should have respect for achieving high levels of                 efficiency and innovation. These propositions are tested empirically on a sample of                 firms, using an innovative application of Boolean algebra.},

The authors compare the form of U.S. home mortgages today with those in other countries. The U.S. mortgage provides many more options to borrowers than are commonly provided elsewhere: American homebuyers can choose whether to pay a fixed or floating rate of interest; they can lock in their interest rate in between the time they apply for the mortgage and the time they purchase their house; they can choose the time at which the mortgage rate resets; they can choose the term and the amortization period; they can prepay freely; and they can generally borrow against home equity freely. They can also obtain home mortgages at attractive terms with very low down payments. The authors discuss the nature of the U.S. government intervention in home mortgage markets that has led to the specific choices available to American homebuyers. They believe that the unique characteristics of the U.S. mortgage provide substantial benefits for American homeowners and the overall stability of the economy.},

In several countries, most prominently the USA, there has been a major shift to financing housing through mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Housing finance systems have evolved differently across countries, although there are elements in common. The chapter addresses these questions: What accounts for these cross-country differences in the structure of housing finance; Is there a process of convergence in structure; and how have these changes affected housing affordability. It presents an international perspective fleshed out with three contrasting case studies. The chapter considers what the implications are for supervisory policies or financial market regulation. A variety of indicators imply that the housing finance revolution in the USA has improved efficiency and consumer welfare. Controlled Vocabulary Terms Finance; housing},

It then gives a brief overview of the findings of majority and minority reports of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. Among other things, it discusses failures in the underwriting modeling process, the supply chain process, the compensation process, and the rating agencies when it came to fueling the crisis.

Another important factor was growth in fees associated with an expansion in household credit, particularly fees associated with residential mortgages. This expansion was fueled by the development of nonbank credit intermediation (or "shadow banking"). We offer a preliminary assessment of whether the growth of active asset management, household credit, and shadow banking -- the main areas of growth in the financial sector -- has been socially beneficial.},

To this purpose, we estimate an error-correction model for US consumption, accounting for the role of household debt flows before and after the crisis. Contrary to an analysis carried out in terms of net wealth, a decomposition of households' assets and liabilities shows how the pre-crisis period was characterized by an excessive indebtedness, which was both a source of short-term growth and of financial instability. In the current ``new normal'' situation, private consumption cannot rely on debt flows as much as before the crisis. This is, therefore, an important ``demand-side'' explanation for the much-debated low growth recovery.},

  abstract = {The housing wealth-to-income ratio has been increasing in most developed economies since the 1950s. In this paper we provide a novel theory to explain this long-term pattern. We show analytically that house prices grow in the long term if i) the housing sector is more land-intensive than the non-housing sector, or ii) technological progress in the construction sector is weaker than in the non-housing sector. The model is calibrated separately to the US, UK, France, and Germany. Quantitatively, both channels are equally relevant for rising house prices. We then study the dynamics in the housing wealth-to-income ratio by computing transitions. The model replicates on average 89 percent of the observed increase in the housing wealth-to-income ratio. The key for replicating the data is the differentiation between residential land as a non-reproducible factor and residential structure as a reproducible factor.},

There is a large growing literature exploring two different approaches: on the one hand, a boom\textendash bust in house prices can generate a boom\textendash bust in credit market and, on the other hand, a boom\textendash bust in credit markets can generate a boom\textendash bust in house prices. We start by presenting a stark mechanical model to formalize the interaction between housing prices and credit markets and explore these two channels in a mechanical way. Next, we present two simple models that highlight the two approaches. First, we propose a catastrophe model, where an increase in credit availability can generate first a boom and then a bust in mortgage markets because of multiple equilibria due to adverse selection: as lending expands, the composition of borrowers worsens and at some point this can generate a crash in credit market. Second, we propose a sentiment model, where house prices increase above fundamentals because investors buy assets under the irrational belief that there is always going to be an ever more foolish buyer, willing to buy at a higher price. In the course of the chapter, we relate our simple models to the large existing literature on these topics. At the end, we also point to some empirical papers that propose related facts.},

Trade-centred approaches highlight the role of cost competitiveness, in particular unit labour costs, and aggregate demand. In contrast, finance-centred approaches focus on gross financial flows, driven by expectations and the return on assets, that impact demand and the exchange rate. This article, first, builds a simple model of the current account that provides a synthesis between the two approaches. Unit labour costs impact the current account via the real exchange rate and income distribution, while financial inflows drive up asset prices, which leads to nominal appreciation and an increase in domestic demand. Second, we estimate a reduced form of this model for 28 OECD countries from 1972 to 2014, controlling for both trade- and finance-centred channels and a wide range of control variables. Our results indicate that finance-centred channels, via equity and residential property prices, drove current account divergence in the OECD, while unit labour costs were less important. They suggest that the effects of gross financial flows deserve more attention in theoretical and empirical models of the current account.},

We show that an estimator based on long differencing the model is much less biased than conventional implementations of the GMM estimator for the dynamic panel model. We also show that under the weak instrument approximation conventional GMM estimators are dominated in terms of mean squared error by an estimator with far less moment conditions. The long difference (LD) estimator mimics the infeasible optimal procedure through its reliance on a small set of moment conditions.},

We illustrate the aims, characteristics, and limitations of several approaches that have been proposed as tools for the analysis of temporal order. Our illustration involves an analysis of the ``gestation activities'' of nascent entrepreneurs, that is, persons involved in the creation of a new firm. We aim to identify temporal sequences of gestation activities that generate or allow a successful outcome of the gestation process, while an occurrence of the same activities in another temporal order will not generate or allow that outcome. First we discuss Event Structure Analysis and Optimal Matching and conclude that these approaches cannot provide the kind of analysis that we are aiming at in this chapter. Then we discuss Temporal Qualitative Comparative Analysis, for which our analysis points to technical limitations that constrain its application. We then present and discuss an alternative approach, Temporal Necessary Condition Analysis.},

  abstract = {This article provides a statistical analysis of core contentions of the `varieties of capitalism' perspective on comparative capitalism. The authors construct indices to assess whether patterns of co-ordination in the OECD economies conform to the predictions of the theory and compare the correspondence of institutions across subspheres of the political economy. They test whether institutional complementarities occur across these subspheres by estimating the impact of complementarities in labour relations and corporate governance on growth rates. To assess the durability of varieties of capitalism, they report on the extent of institutional change in the 1980s and 1990s. Powerful interaction effects across institutions in the subspheres of the political economy must be considered if assessments of the economic impact of institutional reform in any one sphere are to be accurate.},

By evaluating the relationship between the propensity to invest and the rate of growth of demand for the case of the United States economy in the period from 1985 to 2017, our results provide empirical support for this relation, showing that movements in the output growth rate cause the movements in the induced investment ratio. Other significant result shows that the induced investment share presents a high degree of inertia from on period to another, while the effect of the lagged rate of growth of demand is low but statistically significant, suggesting a tendency for utilization to converge towards some exogenous normal level slowly. This feature, together with other estimated parameters of the model, suggest that the Sraffian Supermultiplier adjustment mechanism has been dynamically stable for the US data in the period under analysis.},

  abstract = {The use of simulation modelling techniques by neo-Schumpeterian economists dates back to Nelson and Winter's 1982 book ``An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change'', and has rapidly expanded ever since. This paper considers the way in which successive generations of models have extended the boundaries of research (both with respect to the range of phenomena considered and the different dimensions of innovation that are considered), and while simultaneously introducing novel modelling techniques. At the same time, the paper will highlight the distinct set of features that have emerged in these neo-Schumpeterian models, and which set them apart from the models developed by other schools. In particular, they share a distinct view about the type of world in which real economic agents operate, and a invariably contain a generic set of algorithms. In addition to reviewing past models, the paper considers a number of pressing issues that remain unresolved and which modellers will need to address in future. Notable amongst these are the methodological relationship between empirical studies and simulation (e.g. `history friendly modelling'), the development of common standards for sensitivity analysis, and the need to further extend the boundaries of research in order to consider important aspects of innovation and technical change.},

They take advantage of the greater information regarding bank activities revealed by the financial crisis to consider the reality, across eight of the world's largest developed economies, of the financial power of banks to act as bulwarks against market forces. This article offers a market-based banking framework that transcends the bank-based/capital market\textendash based dichotomy that dominates comparative political economy's consideration of financial systems and argues that future CPE research should focus on the activities of banks. By demonstrating how market-based banking increases market influences on the supply of credit, the authors highlight an underap-preciated source of financial market pressure on nonfinancial companies (NFCs) that can have a potential impact across the range of issues that the varieties of capitalism (VoC) literature has seen as differentiating national systems. This approach has implications in areas such as labor, welfare, innovation, and flexibility.},

Advent of the Euro and the potential for tensions when sovereign nations subsume their monetary policy into a single response also makes monitoring the business cycle of particular interest for Euro area policy makers. In this paper we summarize recent research on three questions relating to cycles in economic activity --- how to extract cyclical information, how to analyse it, and how to enquire into what special difficulties might be encountered when using cyclical indicators. This survey focuses on our own research which we view as a formalization of some of the procedures developed by Burns and Mitchell at the NBER. However, defence of our position goes beyond continuity with the past and is based on the view that the way in which these investigators defined the business cycle is a very natural one that connects with the way policy makers and commentators discuss the cycle.},

  abstract = {Recent research has cast some doubt on the consistency of models that isolate Scandinavian countries as different to other nations in terms of egalitarian welfare states. For example, it has been argued that if occupational welfare polices have their contribution to national welfare better accounted for in comparative models, or if there is a focus on specific aspects of welfare coverage, then Scandinavian welfare states look less different to other European countries. Using case-based methods that try to balance the demand for generalizations and the qualitative integrity of the case, this research examines the specific case of income protection for the older population post-retirement, to see if Scandinavian countries emerge as consistently different when compared with other OECD nations. Scandinavia can be clearly identified in a separate cluster, but it is not alone and other countries also share its similarities. In particular, Scandinavia emerges in a cluster that provides more income replacement and protection for women. In part, this is reinforced by the high rate of labour participation by women in Scandinavian countries. However, there is little evidence of Scandinavian countries retaining noticeable differences and divergence in income protection policies for men.},

  abstract = {A The risk premium puzzle is even worse than previously reported if housing is also taken into consideration next to equity. While housing premia are only moderately smaller than equity premia, they are significantly less volatile and the Sharpe ratio of housing is significantly larger. Hence, three question arise: i) are existing approaches to explain the equity premium puzzle also capable of explaining even larger Sharpe ratios than previously required, ii) can return rates and volatilities of various assets be differentiated, and iii) can different Sharpe ratios between the two risky assets be matched. We analyze these questions, next to business cycle statistics, by including housing into seminal approaches to solve the risk premium puzzle in production economies. Non-disaster economies with habit formation, capital adjustment costs and limited factor mobility fail to generate a Sharpe ratio of housing of the empirically observed size and do not explain co-moving economic activity. A basic model with time-varying disaster risk can reproduce the large Sharpe ratio of housing. Moreover, the model can explain different means and volatilities of the risky assets, economic activity comoves and the model explains the volatility ratio of business investments, residential investments and house prices. However, the model does not allow to disentangle the Sharpe ratios of the risky assets and premia on equity remain too involatile.},

We examine the long-run convergence of the system toward such a growth rate, analyze the related debt dynamics, and deal with stability and income distribution issues.

In a simple closed private one-good economy model, each theory is presented drawing on the relationship between the rate of profit and the rate of growth, as well as on the consideration of one major adjusting variable allowing for the convergence of the endogenous variables of the model to their equilibrium values. This allows for a systematic comparison of exogenous and endogenous variables, of the `logic' or the chain of causalities in each of the approaches, and of the generation of the long-run equilibrium positions of the system. It is finally shown that the post-Kaleckian model is able to cover many but not all of the results generated by the old neoclassical growth model, new neoclassical growth theories, classical\textendash Marxian distribution and growth approaches, and post-Keynesian Kaldor\textendash Robinson and Kalecki\textendash Steindl distribution and growth theories.},

The analysis is based on a demand-driven distribution and growth model for an open economy inspired by Bhaduri and Marglin, which allows for either profit- or wage-led growth. We find that growth in France, Germany, the UK and the USA has been wage-led, whereas Austria and the Netherlands have been profit-led. In the case of Austria a domestically wage-led economy changes to profit-led when including the effect of distribution on external trade. The Netherlands, however, are already profit-led without external trade. Our results so far only partially confirm Bhaduri and Marglin's theoretical conclusion that wage-led growth becomes less feasible when the effects of distribution on foreign trade are taken into account.},

In particular, we specify the conditions for long-run stability of the workers' debt-capital ratio.

  author = {Hein, Eckhard},

  abstract = {We will provide a post-Keynesian macroeconomic model for the classroom. The model is built on the post-Keynesian view of a monetary production economy with creditor-debtor relationships and the endogeneity of the volume of credit and the stock of money. The model contains distribution conflict between firms and workers which will determine the wage and profit shares and may generate conflict inflation, and distribution conflict between rentiers (creditors) and firms (debtors) mainly affected by interest rate policies of the central bank and by (unexpected) inflation generated in the distribution conflict between workers and firms. The model generates a short-run `inflation barrier', which becomes endogenous to demand determined employment and macroeconomic policies in the long run. Based on the model we will provide a full post-Keynesian macroeconomic policy mix as an alternative to the New Consensus Macroeconomics. In this alternative policy package monetary policy should target low long-run real interest rates, take over responsibility for financial stability, and act as a lender of last resort and a guarantor of government debt. Nominal stabilisation should be addressed by income and wage policy, in particular through mediation of distributional conflicts via wage bargaining co-ordination. Real stabilisation and aggregate demand management, both in the short and in the long run, should be the task of fiscal policy, making use of government deficits/surpluses following a `functional finance' approach.},

  abstract = {The Kaleckian models of distribution and growth discussed so far have been criticized by some Neo-Marxian and Neo-Ricardian authors (Auerbach/Skott 1988; Committeri 1986), because the equilibrium rate of capacity utilization in these models may deviate permanently from firms' target rate of utilization, the long-run `normal rate', without any tendency to adjustment.17 This deviation seems to be inconsistent with the requirement that firms' investment decisions should be based on expectations of some `normal rate' of utilization with regard to new productive equipment. Therefore, firms are supposed to adjust productive capacity to demand in the long run, and capacity utilization should be equal to firms' target rate of utilization in a `fully adjusted long-run position'.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses under which circumstances and how configurational comparative methods (i.e. QCA) and statistical methods can be combined to provide tests for the `quasi'-sufficiency of any given set of combination of causal conditions. When combined, QCA provides the ability to explore causal substitutability (i.e. multiple paths to a given outcome) and the ways in which many multiple causes interact with one another to produce effects, while the statistical elements can provide robust indications of the probable validity of postulated hypotheses. The potential utility of the mixed-method approach for analyzing political phenomena is demonstrated by applying it to cross-national data regarding party positions on European integration and party-based Euroscepticism in Western Europe. The findings show that oppositional stances to European integration are partly associated with non-governmental ideological fringe parties on both the left and right. The empirical example presented in this paper demonstrates that configurational methods can be successfully combined with statistical methods and supplement the QCA-framework by providing statistical tests of `almost sufficient' claims. However, combining QCA with statistical methods can sometimes be problematic in middle-sized data analysis, especially as the latter usually cannot handle limited diversity (i.e. insufficient information) in the data and/or overtly complex relationships (i.e. having a large number of conjunctional conditions or interacting variables).},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed increasing interests in integrating temporality into Boolean analysis or Qualitative Comparative Analysis (hereafter QCA). Despite the rapid development of the Boolean method and the extensive application, QCA had been often criticized for its static nature and limitations in analyzing a dynamic process of temporal changes. This article joins the recent efforts in the literature and argues that temporal changes can be analyzed using the existing QCA methods. The article first reviews the existing work on temporal QCA (hereafter TQCA) in a broader context of analyzing temporality in the Boolean method. It then proposes different techniques to analyze dynamic processes of temporal changes through Boolean analysis by incorporating time-series variations into QCA (hereafter TS/QCA), which take sub-forms of Pooled QCA, Fixed Effects QCA, and Time Differencing QCA. Lastly, it maps various types of ``QCA families`` in a typological framework and discusses the challenges that TQCA and TS/QCA face and suggest future directions of methodological innovations.},

  abstract = {Workplace ethnographies suggest many hypotheses about the effects of organizational characteristics on employee attitudes and behaviors. These hypotheses, however, are difficult to evaluate by considering each ethnography individually. The current article uses qualitative comparative analysis of content-coded data from the full population of workplace ethnographies to provide a fuller evaluation of the lessons these ethnographies have to offer. The hypothesis that women are happy and quiescent workers receives only limited support. Women actually evidence less satisfaction and pride in their work than men, but they are more cooperative and less conflictual than men. Autonomy is the most consistent determinant of positive workplace attitudes, a finding that is consistent with survey-based research. These findings thus both confirm and condition prior conclusions about the workplace and suggest the importance of systematically compiling the findings of workplace ethnographies to evaluate and benchmark conclusions based on ethnographic analysis.},

However, their reactions to the crisis greatly differed. While many states passed extensive economic stimulus packages, others solely relied on a restrictive fiscal policy even in times of economic crisis. The composition of the fiscal packages also greatly varied. While some states increased public expenditure and expanded state investments, others enacted considerable tax reductions, thus focusing on an economic stimulus by forgoing public revenue.This paper aims to identify the main political determinants of the different fiscal policy reactions of the OECD member states to the economic crisis. The centerpiece of the comparative analysis consists of political economic determinants of the size and composition of the fiscal packages. A fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis serves to identify the driving forces behind the fiscal policy reactions to the crisis. The conditions are derived from partisan political theory and the ``Varieties of Capitalism'' approach while other factors are controlled for.},

  abstract = {Inequality of income distribution in Brazil: the contribution of pensions and of other components of per capita household income The paper starts with a discussion of methodological problems that arise when measuring whether a component of total income is progressive or regressive, v.g., whether such component contributes to reduce or to increase the inequality of the income distribution. Next, it examines the data of the last National Sample Survey of Households of Brazil (PNAD, 2007), to update the analysis of the distribution of per capita household income in Brazil and verify how income from work (of the military and civil servants, of other employees, of self-employed and of employers), from pensions, from rents and from other components of income influence income inequality in Brazil. Finally, it examines how each of these components contributed to reduce the Gini index of the distribution of per capita household income in Brazil in the period 2001-2007. It becomes evident that about 50\% of such reduction in the Gini index is associated with changes in the income component ``wages in the private sector''. Another conclusion is that the pensions provided by the official system are regressive, even though changes in the income from pensions in the last years have contributed to the reduction of the Gini index.},

Cointegration analysis suggests that property prices are an important determinant of the long-run borrowing capacity of the private sector, which needs to be taken into account to explain the long-run movements of bank lending. Impulse response analysis reveals that innovations to property prices also have a highly significant and persistent positive dynamic effect on bank lending. This result suggests that innovations to property prices may give rise to significant and persistent cycles in bank lending and are thus a potential explanation for the persistent financial cycles observed in the past.

  abstract = {In almost all European welfare states, immigrants face a higher risk of poverty than natives, but the gap between the two groups varies. In examining this variation, our article contributes to the nascent literature on the impact of welfare states on immigrants. We hypothesize that whether immigrants benefit from welfare generosity depends on three intervening factors: immigration policy, labor market regulation, and welfare eligibility rules. We use fuzzy-set analysis to examine the interplay of these determinants in 16 West-European states. The findings show that in most countries a high migrant disadvantage results from the combination of a large share of humanitarian and family immigrants and generous social policies. The underlying mechanism is that ``unwanted'' immigrants are institutionally impeded from full access to generous welfare states.},

Several hypotheses are put to the test: first, a classical partisan difference argument; second, a varieties of capitalism approach proposing a successful joint rallying of employers and employees for subsidization in coordinated market economies; and, lastly, the merged hypothesis that right?wing parties in a coordinated economic context might subsidize feeling the pressure to overcompensate an ?issue ownership? of left parties in the field of employee?friendly policies. We identify four explanatory paths: coordinated economies in the sample subsidized when they were economically closed or highly indebted. The results also support our combined hypothesis, that New Zealand ? a left?governed liberal market economy ? and right?governed coordinated market economies of the non?Scandinavian type subsidized.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted construction, made it difficult for many households to pay for shelter, and seriously hurt the housing sector. Governments have responded with a wide array of measures to protect tenants and mortgage-holders, as well as support builders and lenders. This note mobilises web-search data to shed new light on the impact of the crisis on the construction sector. It then takes stock of measures taken by governments and argues that some of the relief could, if not duly phased out as planned, create unintended inefficiencies and notably make housing supply less responsive to changes in demand and the evolving needs of society. The note concludes by building on recent empirical findings that stress the importance of gradually transitioning from immediate rescue measures to policy settings that can support the recovery and the development of efficient, inclusive and sustainable housing markets.},

  abstract = {China is an ownership society, but with a paradox \textendash{} many homeowners do not live in the apartments/houses they own, and instead live in rental housing. This is different from the pattern in Western economies where households own multiple properties but still live in an owned unit. The paper is situated within the literature on the financialization of housing and the changing meaning of homeownership. We examine the paradox by studying its patterns and dynamics using 2017 China Household Finance Survey data. We find that the owner-renting in China is a result of spatial, temporal and functional mismatches between housing needs. The intrinsic investment strategy and services linked to homeownership have made it imperative to own homes, regardless a household's housing needs. Young, single, better-off and split households, and those in large, expensive cities are more likely to be owners-renting. In addition, institutional barriers in the housing market such as migrant status, housing purchase limit policy, and subsidized housing encourage owner-renting.},

We go beyond existing scholarship by specifying which aspects of financialization can be expected to increase inequality and where in the income distribution this effect will occur. We also show that this effect is contingent on institutional context. We posit that the shareholder model of corporate governance and the growing demand for financial professionals are the two dimensions of financialization that drive up pre-tax income inequality. Nevertheless, the spread of the shareholder value model only benefits the very top income earners. We further argue that the institutional strength of labor shapes the relationship between financialization and inequality. We analyze effects of indicators of these two dimensions of financialization on the top 1\% and the next 9\% income shares and on the 90:50 earnings ratio. We test our hypotheses with data on 18 post-industrial democracies between 1960 and 2015.},

  abstract = {This study aims to develop an empirical measurement framework of the green state and compare twenty-four OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries\&rsquo; cases through the fuzzy-set multiple conjunctural analysis and the ideal type analysis. Based on the analysis model of the outcome set (Sustainable Development Goal Index) and the causal sets of seven variables on the four green state categories (\&lsquo;ecological authoritarian state\&rsquo;, \&lsquo;ecological modern state\&rsquo;, \&lsquo;ecological democracy state\&rsquo;, and \&lsquo;ecological welfare state\&rsquo;), this study reveals the following results. Among OECD member countries, if ones have high environmental tax, high environmental innovation (patent), high economic development and democracy, high levels of environmental governance and social expenditure, or have high economic development and democracy, and high levels of environmental governance and environmental health, they can be seen to have reached a high level of green state (consistency: 0.980, total coverage: 0.675). Also, the thirteen ideal types of green state of twenty-four OECD countries were derived. Norway (fuzzy-set membership score of 0.515) is a country of Type 1, with a characteristic of \&lsquo;strong green state\&rsquo; having all high features of the four green state categories. Greece (membership score, 0.692) and Ireland (0.577) belong to Type 13, characterized by \&lsquo;weak green state\&rsquo; with all four low features. As a result, the green state types of the twenty-four OECD countries can be assorted into five levels: \&lsquo;Strong Green State\&rsquo;, \&lsquo;Quasi-Strong Green State\&rsquo;, \&lsquo;Quasi-Green State\&rsquo;, \&lsquo;Quasi-Weak Green State\&rsquo;, and \&lsquo;Weak Green State\&rsquo;.},

  abstract = {In both the industrialized and developing worlds, a distinctive feature of the last two decades has been prolonged buildups and sharp collapses in asset markets such as stock, housing, and exchange markets. The volatility has sparked intense debate in academic and policy circles over the appropriate monetary and regulatory response to dramatic market shifts. This book examines asset price bubbles to further our understanding of the causes and implications of financial instability, focusing on the potential of central banks and regulatory agencies to prevent it. The book grew out of a conference jointly sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the World Bank Group in April 2002.},

After discussing a few stylized facts regarding the macroeconomic importance of housing markets, the chapter presents key results from the Iacoviello and Neri's (2010) DSGE model with housing, a model that is increasingly used in quantitative monetary policy analysis. Directions for further research are then suggested, focusing on the role of financial intermediation, the determinants of house prices and their persistence, the role of economic policy to stabilize house prices and the link between housing and labour markets.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes unit root tests for dynamic heterogeneous panels based on the mean of individual unit root statistics. In particular it proposes a standardized t-bar test statistic based on the (augmented) Dickey\textendash Fuller statistics averaged across the groups. Under a general setting this statistic is shown to converge in probability to a standard normal variate sequentially with T (the time series dimension) \textrightarrow{$\infty$}, followed by N (the cross sectional dimension) \textrightarrow{$\infty$}. A diagonal convergence result with T and N\textrightarrow{$\infty$} while N/T\textrightarrow k,k being a finite non-negative constant, is also conjectured. In the special case where errors in individual Dickey\textendash Fuller (DF) regressions are serially uncorrelated a modified version of the standardized t-bar statistic is shown to be distributed as standard normal as N\textrightarrow{$\infty$} for a fixed T, so long as T{$>$}5 in the case of DF regressions with intercepts and T{$>$}6 in the case of DF regressions with intercepts and linear time trends. An exact fixed N and T test is also developed using the simple average of the DF statistics. Monte Carlo results show that if a large enough lag order is selected for the underlying ADF regressions, then the small sample performances of the t-bar test is reasonably satisfactory and generally better than the test proposed by Levin and Lin (Unpublished manuscript, University of California, San Diego, 1993).},

Excessive levels of inequality can erode social cohesion, lead to political polarization, and ultimately lower economic growth, but whether inequality is excessive depends on country-specific factors, including the growth context in which inequality arises, along with societal preferences. This Fiscal Monitor focuses on how fiscal policy can help governments address high levels of inequality while minimizing potential trade-offs between efficiency and equity.},

  abstract = {The connection between democracy and transparency would appear to be strong. Democratic countries have been among the earliest adopters of new legislation in transparency reforms such as access to information (ATI) laws. However, research has not yet tested the connection in the context of democratic reform where transitioning countries have the option to adopt ATI laws, and yet may, nevertheless, neglect or delay passage of such laws. To address this question, this paper uses Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) with 23 countries that are in democratic transition in the fourth wave of democratic transition in the 21st century. The results show that low political competition in conjunction with strong civil society, regional pressure and recognition of international norms is favourable to ATI adoption. In contrast, the non-ATI adopters have encountered high political competition coupled with low regional pressure, weak international norms, and weak press freedoms.},

Following the spread of COVID-19 and increased financial volatility, the growth of FDI and trade outlook for the region in 2020 has been sharply downgraded. This study aims to observe empirically the effect of government spending in heath sectors on economic growth during in the early stage Covid 19 outbreak in Malaysia. As the world has awakened to the potential risks of Covid 19, there has been a massive effort to add capacity to the healthcare system rapidly. In Malaysia, apart from stressing the need for the public to strictly adhere to the Movement Control Order (MCO), the government an immediate boost in funding for healthcare services through initial stage fiscal policy response to Covid 19 outbreak. This research used Dynamic Panel Data also known as longitudinal study, observed data over the four month from December, 2019 to March, 2020 in 5 selected Asia Country that involving with Covid 19. In term of limitation, this study just focusses on four month of data from selected Asia country involved with Covid-19. Panel causality results suggest bidirectional linkages between healthcare sector growth and government spending. Empirical findings suggest that fiscal policy reforms are required to channelize healthcare sector growth to a more government spending resulting from fiscal policy designed by the government of Malaysia. In addition, Panel causality results suggest bidirectional linkages between inward FDI and regulatory quality. Empirical findings suggest that economic policy reforms are required to channelize regulatory quality of COVID-19 to a more foreign capital inflows. The governments of Asian countries should pull out policies on FDI inflows and the environment in order to achieve sustainable economic growth and development. The regulators of other countries should pull out fiscal policies on government policy to achieve sustainable economic growth and health sector growth development.},

With national house prices reaching record highs across all major cities, future market prospects became a topic of significant debate among policymakers, investors and the populace. Design/methodology/approach A triangulation of well-established academic methods is used to perform investigation. The models include Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter, volatility autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH approximation) and right tail augmented Dickey\textendash Fuller (Rtadf) test (bubble screening technique). Findings Interestingly, over the years from 1985 to 2019 research period, filtering extracts only one Dutch national housing cycle. This is a somewhat distinct characteristic compared to other advanced Western economies (inter alia the UK and the USA) where markets tend to experience 8- to 10-year gyrations. Volatility and Rtadf test suggest that current house prices in most Dutch cities are in excess of historical averages and statistical thresholds. House price levels in Almere, Amsterdam, The Hague, Groningen, Rotterdam and Utrecht are of particular concern. Originality/value Retail investors should therefore be cautious as they are entering the market at the time of elevated housing values. For institutional investors, those investing in long-term, housing in key Dutch metropolitan areas, even if values decline, is still an attractive investment conduit.},

The paper evaluates a specific mortgage market reform proposal to abolish the GSEs and substitute privative market incentives for mortgage originators, securitizers, and investors, while retaining the FHA and HUD programs in support of lower-income and first-time homebuyers. The paper assembles data showing that stable housing and mortgage activity can be sustained with minimal governmental intervention, including data that demonstrate the success of European housing and mortgage markets that operate with little government intervention.},

  abstract = {After the 2007 credit crisis, financial bubbles have once again emerged as a topic of current concern. An open problem is to determine in real time whether or not a given asset's price process exhibits a bubble. Due to recent progress in the characterization of asset price bubbles using the arbitrage-free martingale pricing technology, we are able to propose a new methodology for answering this question based on the asset's price volatility. We limit ourselves to the special case of a risky asset's price being modeled by a Brownian driven stochastic differential equation. Such models are ubiquitous both in theory and in practice. Our methods use sophisticated volatility estimation techniques combined with the method of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We illustrate these techniques using several stocks from the alleged Internet dot-com episode of 1998\textendash 2001, where price bubbles were widely thought to have existed. Our results confirm the suspicions of the presence of bubbles in many of the dot-com stocks of 1998\textendash 2001.},

  abstract = {Scholars have documented the importance of national-level factors for the competitive success of firms on a global scale. These studies typically identify multiple factors that are behind the emergence of large and successful firms in particular national clusters. However, there has been relatively little research identifying whether such factors are all collectively necessary to produce the outcome, or whether only a few of the factors in different combinations might be sufficient to generate the shift in competitive advantage manifested in the market power of large ``flagship'' firms. In this paper, we study the evolution of one industry across six countries in which the competitive position of national firms changed considerably during our 100-year analysis period. The results of our combined historical and fuzzy-set analyses show that an unequal distribution of resources may lead to alternative causal pathways to competitive advantage of the largest firms.},

We show that the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator is mixed Gaussian.

  abstract = {International political economy identifies declining nominal interest rates, securitization, and financial liberalization as drivers of rising housing prices. Despite witnessing these common credit shocks, however, developed economies experienced divergent trends in housing inflation since the 1980s. We offer a comparative political economy explanation of variation in house prices, arguing that by restraining household incomes, wage-setting institutions can blunt financial liberalization's inflationary impact on housing markets. Employing quantitative analysis and a comparative study of Ireland and the Netherlands, we uncover two findings. First, countries where political coalitions in the export sector held veto powers over those in the nontraded sector in national wage setting realized lower housing inflation. Second, the impact of sectoral coalitions on housing prices in OECD countries is similar to that of financial variables. Our results suggest that the organization of labor politics continues to play an important role in mitigating the destabilizing effects of global finance on developed economies.},

(3) The long-term accessibility of homeownership and its affordability for young adults. (4) The price adjustment in housing markets following the financial crisis has been relatively weak when contrasted with housing construction activity that has collapsed. (5) The post-credit-crunch world with tight public sector finances means that new models of funding are required for social housing blurring the differences with private rented accommodation. (6) Private landlordism had flourished in the housing boom but there were doubts about its future growth.},

This chapter begins by illustrating the scale of the impact of the credit crunch by reference to the extreme example of Ireland. It then sets out a statistical overview to international housing market trends over the past four decades by examining price cycles. These trends demonstrate that the links between the macroeconomy and the housing market vary between countries. The next section reviews the fundamental dynamics of the housing market and the importance of tenure institutional structures and market parameters in each country. The following section discusses in more detail the relationships between the housing market and the economy. The chapter then outlines the origins and impact of the recent international fi nancial crisis on house prices in individual countries.},

In contrast to Kaldor's facts, which revolved around a single state variable, physical capital, our six updated facts force consideration of four far more interesting variables: ideas, institutions, population, and human capital. Dynamic models have uncovered subtle interactions between these variables and generated important insights about such big questions as: Why has growth accelerated? Why are there gains from trade?},

This ``financial hockey stick'' coincides with shifts in foundational macroeconomic relationships beyond the widely-noted return of macroeconomic fragility and crisis risk. Leverage is correlated with central business cycle moments, which we can document thanks to a decade-long international and historical data collection effort. More financialized economies exhibit somewhat less real volatility, but also lower growth, more tail risk, as well as tighter real-real and real-financial correlations. International real and financial cycles also cohere more strongly. The new stylized facts that we discover should prove fertile ground for the development of a new generation of macroeconomic models with a prominent role for financial factors.},

This paper analyzes the role of interest rates and credit in driving house price booms and busts with data spanning 140years of modern economic history in the advanced economies. We exploit the implications of the macroeconomic policy trilemma to identify exogenous variation in monetary conditions: countries with fixed exchange regimes often see fluctuations in short-term interest rates unrelated to home economic conditions. We use novel instrumental variable local projection methods to demonstrate that loose monetary conditions lead to booms in real estate lending and house prices' bubbles; these, in turn, materially heighten the risk of financial crises. Both effects have become stronger in the postwar era.},

Using a new database for the U.S. and 15 other advanced economies from 1870 to the present that includes housing as well as equity returns (to capture the full risky capital portfolio of the representative agent), standard calculations using returns to total wealth and consumption show that: housing returns in the long run are comparable to those of equities, and yet housing returns have lower volatility and lower covariance with consumption growth than equities. The same applies to a weighted total-wealth portfolio, and over a range of horizons. As a result, the implied risk aversion parameters for housing wealth and total wealth are even larger than those for equities, often by a factor of 2 or more. We find that more exotic models cannot resolve these even bigger puzzles, and we see little role for limited participation, idiosyncratic housing risk, transaction costs, or liquidity premiums.},

  abstract = {Capitalism is the dominant economic system adopted throughout the global economy, but there are many different models of capitalism practiced depending on what the society decides ``economic effectiveness'' is. In this study, we assert that an effective economy simultaneously achieves two seemingly divergent outcomes: it (1) creates economic wealth efficiently, and (2) shares that wealth equitably. Employing insights from Whitley's national business systems framework and fuzzy set analysis, we examine how national institutions collectively configure with respect to the overall level of equitable wealth creation within 48 developed and developing economies. We find that three configurations are associated with relatively high levels of equitable wealth creation, and another three are associated with relatively low levels. As such, our analysis supports the notion of equifinality \textendash{} that there is no one optimal model of capitalism. Furthermore, we begin to demonstrate that these models of capitalism are constantly evolving, but their evolution is generally slow even when considering the practice of capitalism before and after the 2008 global economic crisis. We discuss the implications of these findings for the study of international business, with a special emphasis on considering a more holistic context for exploring how multinational enterprises interact with their institutional environment(s).},

The authors analyse the ecosystems of 43 countries using fsQCA in order to establish the configurations of ecosystem components that enable financial inclusion and those that lead to financial exclusion. Results show that there are three configurations of factors affecting financial inclusion: high socio-demographic and political factors in the absence of economical development; high social, technological and economical factors in the absence of political development; and political and economical factors in the absence of social and technological development. Two combinations of factors affecting financial exclusion are the absence of social and economical factors in the presence of political and technological development; finally, the configuration with absent socio-demographic, technological and political factors of development. The results obtained have policy implications for countries seeking to develop financial inclusion, outlining the most important spheres of the ecosystem to promote and support.},

A novel price index for residential property prices covering the whole country going back to 1993 is used in a macroeconomic model to estimate key housing market elasticities for Germany. A decomposition suggests that the land price component of house prices is relatively elastic with respect to income and interest rates, while the construction price component responds to income and the level of construction activity. The decomposition also highlights countervailing house price effects of a supply increase: A dampening effect via land prices and a stimulating effect via construction prices.},

  abstract = {This article argues, using the example of Brazil, that the changing nature of developing and emerging countries' (DECs) financial integration has created new forms of external vulnerability, causing large and volatile capital and exchange rate movements. Despite sound fundamentals and a substantial reduction in its traditional external vulnerabilities, the Brazilian real has been one of the most volatile currencies over recent years. The article argues that this has been the result of the surging exposure of foreign investors in an increasingly complex set of very short-term domestic currency assets. Following a Minskyan analysis, we demonstrate that the changing nature of Brazil's external vulnerability confirms both the inherent and endogenous instability of international capital flows and DECs' subordinate role in the international financial system. We conclude with policy recommendations to reduce DECs' external vulnerability sustainably.},

We show that the OLS, FMOLS, and DOLS estimators are all asymptotically normally distributed. However, the asymptotic distribution of the OLS estimator is shown to have a non-zero mean. Monte Carlo results illustrate the sampling behavior of the proposed estimators and show that (1) the OLS estimator has a non-negligible bias in finite samples, (2) the FMOLS estimator does not improve over the OLS estimator in general, and (3) the DOLS outperforms both the OLS and FMOLS estimators.},

Specifically, it integrates the Veblenian concept of conspicuous consumption into a typical Bhaduri-Marglin model by assuming that relative consumption concerns matter primarily within the working class. If in such a framework the profit share increases and the corresponding decrease in workers' income is distributed unevenly, efforts to ''keep up with the Joneses'' may increase consumption and, hence, lead to a consumption-driven profit-led regime. The model's empirical relevance is illustrated with respect to the pre-crisis developments as observed in the U.S.},

  abstract = {We build a model of the U.S. economy with multiple aggregate shocks (income, housing finance conditions, and beliefs about future housing demand) that generate fluctuations in equilibrium house prices. Through a series of counterfactual experiments, we study the housing boom and bust around the Great Recession and obtain three main results. First, we find that the main driver of movements in house prices and rents was a shift in beliefs. Shifts in credit conditions do not move house prices but are important for the dynamics of home ownership, leverage, and foreclosures. The role of housing rental markets and long-term mortgages in alleviating credit constraints is central to these findings. Second, our model suggests that the boom-bust in house prices explains half of the corresponding swings in non-durable expenditures and that the transmission mechanism is a wealth effect through household balance sheets. Third, we find that a large-scale debt forgiveness program would have done little to temper the collapse of house prices and expenditures, but would have dramatically reduced foreclosures and induced a small, but persistent, increase in consumption during the recovery.},

The rules are: (i) government expenditures as a fixed proportion of GDP; (ii) government deficit as a fixed proportion of GDP; (iii) government debt as a fixed proportion of GDP; and (iv) a balanced budget. Next, the economic trends implied by each rule are analyzed, and they are all compared. Some of the main findings of the exercise can be summarized as follows: the a priori more expansionist (or less contractionist) rules present higher growth rates, ex post; there is an inverse relationship between government debt and firms' debt, with the former being higher under the first rule, and lower in the balanced budget rule, the opposite happening in the case of firms' debt. Finally, considering enterprises' profitability, we conclude that the best fiscal rule for firms is the first one, and, for the banking sector, not surprisingly, it is the balanced budget rule.},

  abstract = {The financialisation literature has grown over the past decades. Despite a generally accepted definition, financialisation has been used to describe different phenomena. We distinguish between financialisation of non-financial companies, households and the financial sector and use activity and vulnerability measures. We identify seven financialisation hypotheses in the literature and empirically investigate them in a cross-country analysis for 17 OECD countries for 1997-2007. We find different financialisation measures are only weakly correlated, suggesting the existence of distinct financialisation processes. There is strong evidence that financialisation is linked to asset price inflation and correlated with a debt-driven demand regime. Financial deregulation encourages financialisation. There is limited evidence that market-based financial systems are more financialised. Foreign financial inflows do not seem a main driver. We do not find indication that an investment slowdown precedes financialisation. Our findings suggest financialisation should be understood as variegated process, playing out differently across economic sectors and countries.},

This paper presents an agent-based model (ABM) to model the housing market from 1986 to 2017. We provide a unique approach to simulating the financial market along with analyzing the phenomenon of emergence resulting from the interactions among consumers, banks and the Federal Reserve. This paper specifically focuses on the emergence of ``underwater mortgages'' and the macroeconomics of the housing market. The market value of a property is heavily influence by the value of a neighboring property; therefore, individuals are able to gauge the probable value of a property that has not been developed yet. The blend of available financial products to consumers (i.e., ARM versus Fixed-Rate) certainly influences demand within the housing market given that ARM products are more affordable than fixed-rate products. Policymakers and financial institutions should work together to develop programs, which monitor the supply of these historically easy to access financial products and prevent the risk of underwater mortgages and crashes.},

These events call into question the canonical life-cycle theory of consumption, with its benign view of debt as a neutral instrument of optimal intertemporal expenditure smoothing. This paper draws attention to an alternative, post-Keynesian account of consumption spending in which current income, household borrowing and household indebtedness all affect current consumption. Central to the analysis is an empirical investigation of US consumption spending since the 1950s. The results of this inquiry cast doubt on the life-cycle hypothesis, but are congruent with the alternative, post-Keynesian account of consumption.},

It starts with an overview of the size, growth, and volatility of residential investment in conjunction with long-term resource allocation and short-term macroeconomic fluctuations. Then, the evolution of housing finance and its implications for recent house price run-up are discussed. The relationships among housing price, consumer spending, and inflation are also investigated. Particular attention is paid to the debate over house price bubbles, housing wealth effects on consumption, and the causality between house price and inflation. The paper concludes with a brief assessment of government intervention to stabilize house prices.},

The objective of stock flow modeling should be the ability to practically model unstable macro-economies, and in particular their interactions with the financial sector. These models should provide `Words to the Wise', and until they do, they are just thought experiments.},

Shocks to real estate prices shift firms' debt capacity, which has a significant impact not only on firm investment but also on the investment of peer firms: a \$1 of increase in the price of peer real estate assets induces a \$0.072 increase in investment. The peer effect from corporate real estate is stronger when firms or their peers have more investment opportunities; financially constrained firms invest more out of their own price shocks, while the peer effect is stronger for unconstrained firms; and we find significant peer effects within but not between - groups of small and large firms, respectively. Overall, we document a new channel through which real estate is an economically significant determinant of corporate finance.},

Works in the financialisation literature have tried to explain this phenomenon by arguing that rising financial payments and purchases have come at the expense of productive investment.This article shows that such arguments are not supported by the data. It also explains theoretically why rising dividend payments and the growth of corporations' portfolio investment are compatible with the fact that corporations' productive investment did not decline during the first two decades of `neoliberalism' in the USA.There would necessarily be a trade-off between these uses of funds if they were all funded out of current profits, but there is no necessary trade-off because borrowed funds are an additional source. Finally, the article shows that the fall in US corporations' rate of profit (rate of return on investment in fixed assets) fully accounts for the fall in their rate of capital accumulation.},

The chapter uses an econometric model to explore the reasons for the decline in the household saving rate and the role HEW might play, focusing on four explanatory variables.

This evidence is consistent with a model where the trend in housing demand is determined by demographic factors and economic well-being to which supply adjusts so slowly that real house prices are affected persistently. Reunification seems to have induced two structural changes in the empirical housingmarketmodel. First, the speed of equilibriumadjustment via residential investment slowed down substantially and real house prices lost the capacity to contribute to the adjustment process. Second, the degree of persistence in the error correction term increased a lot. The changing features are key to explain significant differences in alternative trend-cycle decompositions of residential investment.},

We show that real house prices stayed constant from the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, but rose strongly and with substantial cross-country variation in the second half of the twentieth century. Land prices, not replacement costs, are the key to understanding the trajectory of house prices. Rising land prices explain about 80 percent of the global house price boom that has taken place since World War II. Our findings have implications for the evolution of wealth-to-income ratios, the growth effects of agglomeration, and the price elasticity of housing supply.},

  abstract = {Real estate prices can deviate from their fundamental value due to rigid supply, heterogeneity in quality, and various market imperfections, which have two contrasting effects on bank stability. Higher prices increase the value of collateral and net wealth of borrowers and thus reduce the likelihood of credit defaults. In contrast, persistent deviations from fundamentals may foster the adverse selection of increasingly risky creditors by banks seeking to expand their loan portfolios, which increases bank distress probabilities. We test these hypotheses using unique data on real estate markets and banks in Germany. House price deviations contribute to bank instability, but nominal house price developments do not. This finding corroborates the importance of deviations from the fundamental value of real estate, rather than just price levels or changes alone, when assessing bank stability.},

As one of the main drivers of financial sector growth, mortgages have traditionally been hailed as increasing the number of homeowners in a country. This article uses long-run panel data for seventeen countries between 1920 (1950) and 2013 to show that the effect of the ``great mortgaging'' on homeownership rates is not universally positive. Increasing mortgage debt appears to be neither necessary nor sufficient for higher homeownership levels. There were periods of rising homeownership levels without much increase in mortgages before 1980, thanks to government programs, purchasing power increases, and less inflated house prices. There have also been mortgage increases without homeownership growth, but with house price bubbles thereafter. The liberalization of financial markets might after all be a poor substitute for more traditional housing policies.},

It was developed by the social scientist Prof. Charles C. Ragin. fsQCA seeks to establish logical connections between combinations of causal conditions and an outcome, the result being rules that describe how combinations of causal conditions would cause the desired outcome. So, each rule is a possible path from the causal conditions to the outcome. The rules are connected by the word OR to the output. To actually apply fsQCA to some engineering data problems, there are some challenges that had to be overcome. We explain the challenges and how they have been overcome. We also illustrate the application of fsQCA to the well-known Auto MPG dataset to obtain causal combinations that explain Low MPG 4-cylinder cars.},

The previous two expansions, of the 1990s and 2000s, were prolonged by big asset bubbles, which have played a key role in the neoliberal era in promoting long economic expansions. However, the current expansion has not seen an asset bubble large enough to significantly affect the macroeconomy. This paper examines the expansion since 2009 by analyzing the movements of the rate of profit, and its determinants, and the role of aggregate demand, with the aim of determining the factors that have kept crisis tendencies at bay so far., JEL Classification: E32, E30, E11, E02},

  abstract = {Wage growth and consumer price inflation in the United States remain weak, despite robust labor market and a healthy economy. This has been a conundrum for policymakers and economists alike, albeit it is not without parallels. In this paper, we analyze recent trends in the labor market. We point out that a number of indicators are providing mixed signals about the tight labor market, including wage growth that has remained muted, vacancy duration rates that have stayed remarkable stable in certain sectors, and the rate of capacity utilization, which is cyclically low and out of sync with other measures of resource utilization (e.g., output gap and unemployment rate). This leads us to conclude that there could be other forces that explain these phenomena. In this paper, we focus on capacity utilization and contend that low capacity utilization rates are the outcome of strategic decision-making by corporations, rather than inefficient demand, which permits firms to manage their resources more effectively. It seems to be particularly important when economic and policy uncertainties are elevated, such as in the post-financial crisis environment. More flexible use of capacity has implications not only for the labor market, but also for investments. Understanding capacity utilization would contribute to monetary policy formulation when the signal coming from the rate of capacity utilization is not consistent with those coming from the labor market and the output gap. This points to the need to continue monitor a broad range of indicators to avoid potential policy errors.},

This article demonstrates, however, that fsQCA is an extraordinarily sensitive method whose results are worryingly susceptible to minor parametric and model specification changes. We make two specific claims. First, the causal conditions identified by fsQCA as being sufficient for an outcome to occur are highly contingent upon the values of several key parameters selected by the user. Second, fsQCA results are subject to marked confirmation bias. Given its tendency toward finding complex connections between variables, the method is highly likely to identify as sufficient for an outcome causal combinations containing even randomly generated variables. To support these arguments, we replicate three articles utilizing fsQCA and conduct sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations to assess the impact of small changes in parameter values and the method's built-in confirmation bias on the overall conclusions about sufficient conditions.},

One common method of assessing result stability is the ``drop-one'' sensitivity test, which repeatedly reruns a particular analysis, each time dropping a single case. We find that, for the number of cases to which analysts most routinely apply QCA, this type of sensitivity analysis produces paradoxical results. Directly contrary to the standard expectation that more robust findings emerge with a higher n/k ratio, we discover that QCA findings based on a lower n/k ratio prove to be more stable. This result calls into question the validity of the drop-one test as a sensitivity metric for QCA.},

  abstract = {While qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) has often been portrayed as an alternative to mainstream statistical methods, there is a growing debate on how the techniques can be combined. This article shows how, using a sequential design, the integration of a large-N survival analysis with a smaller-N QCA yielded new insights about the reasons for project delay in a multiproject organization. While the regression served to trace significant explanatory variables and their net effects, the QCA nuanced these findings by demonstrating how variables combine across distinct categories of cases. As a result, the differing logics underlying externally and internally generated delays were elucidated. Implications for our understanding of multiproject organizing and for mixed methods research are discussed.},

Two aspects of capital utilization are distinguished: (1) the microeconomic aspect of the choice among alternative systems of operation of plant and equipment; and (2) the macroeconomic aspect of which proportion of the existing capital stock will actually be used. Some support is provided for the view that the short run is sometimes a "cooperative game" in which both labor and capital gain. Copyright 1990 by Oxford University Press.},

Introducing long-term nominal mortgages, and an estimated process for nominal interest rates, into a standard model aligns the theory with observations on starts, as mortgages transmit nominal rates into real housing costs. Longer time to build makes residential investment cyclically coincident.},

This technique allows simultaneously addressing individual e ects, numerous periods, and in turn, the endogeneity of the model or independent regressors. Despite these advantages, there are several methodological and practical limitations to perform estimations using this tool. There are two types of models that can be estimated with Panel data: Static and Dynamic, the former is the most developed while dynamic models still have some theoretical and practical constraints. This paper focuses precisely on the latter, Dynamic panel data, using an approach that combines theory and praxis, and paying special attention on its applicability on macroeonomic data, specially datasets with a long period of time and a small number of individuals, also called long panels.},

  abstract = {Introdu\c{c}\~ao retomada do crescimento se apresenta como um dos grandes desafios para a sociedade brasileira ap\'os dois anos de profunda crise, em 2015 e 2016. Depois de um per\'iodo de expans\~ao da renda e diminui\c{c}\~ao da desi-gualdade na primeira d\'ecada deste s\'eculo, fortemente influenciada pelo desem-penho da economia mundial e da eleva\c{c}\~ao dos pre\c{c}os das commodities, vemo--nos novamente diante da recess\~ao e seus reflexos. Recuperar os investimentos \'e algo que se mostra imprescind\'ivel para a sa\'ida da crise. Foram v\'arios os fatores que fizeram que houvesse essa retra\c{c}\~ao. O almejado ajuste fiscal implicou cortes de gastos, incluindo os investi-mentos, n\~ao apenas por parte da Uni\~ao, mas tamb\'em dos estados e munic\'ipios. Ressalte-se ainda que o aumento da taxa b\'asica de juros (Selic) e a sua manuten-\c{c}\~ao em n\'ivel elevado, al\'em de estimular as aplica\c{c}\~oes financeiras em detrimento dos investimentos na produ\c{c}\~ao e infraestrutura, tamb\'em encareceu o custo do cr\'edito e do financiamento, outro fator desestimulador das novas invers\~oes. Um terceiro fator foi o impacto da retra\c{c}\~ao chinesa e a queda nos pre\c{c}os das commodities. Ao contr\'ario do se poderia pensar, a diminui\c{c}\~ao dos pre\c{c}os do petr\'oleo bruto, dos min\'erios e da soja, para citar os principais, n\~ao afetou so-mente o resultado das exporta\c{c}\~oes, mas tamb\'em inibiu novos projetos por parte de grandes empresas, devido \`a queda da sua receita e rentabilidade. O quarto fator, a Opera\c{c}\~ao Lava Jato, sem entrar no m\'erito da sua utilida-de para coibir a corrup\c{c}\~ao, tem significado na pr\'atica a paralisia de setores-chave para o pa\'is, como os complexos de petr\'oleo e g\'as, constru\c{c}\~ao pesada e toda a sua cadeia de fornecedores e prestadores de servi\c{c}os. Por \'ultimo, mas n\~ao menos importante, a crise pol\'itica gera incerteza quanto ao futuro, tamb\'em impactando negativamente as decis\~oes, levando ao adiamento, ou mesmo cancelamento de investimentos. Como todos esses fatores continuam presentes no cen\'ario pol\'itico-eco-n\^omico, nada nos faz crer que o quadro possa se alterar e teremos uma nova retra\c{c}\~ao expressiva nos investimentos este ano. Mas, por outro lado, nada indica que estejamos fadados a uma crise intermi-n\'avel. H\'a aspectos relevantes a serem considerados. O Brasil \'e o \'unico pa\'is do G-20 que tem, por exemplo, uma expressiva demanda ainda reprimida na infraestrutura. H\'a muitas outras oportunidades no agroneg\'ocio, na ind\'ustria e nos servi\c{c}os. Din\^amica e evolu\c{c}\~ao da crise: discutindo alternativas ANTONIO CORR\^EA DE LACERDA I A 10.1590/s0103-40142017.31890005 ESTUDOS AVAN\c{C}ADOS 31 (89), 2017 38 Isso talvez explique a atratividade da economia brasileira para investimen-tos do exterior que tem coberto com sobra os d\'eficits no balan\c{c}o de transa\c{c}\~oes correntes. S\'o de investimentos diretos estrangeiros houve ingressos de US\$ 79 bilh\~oes no acumulado de 2016, colocando-nos dentre os sete pa\'ises que mais receberam essa modalidade de capitais, que incluem as fus\~oes e aquisi\c{c}\~oes e ainda os empr\'estimos intercompanhia. Ou seja, apesar da crise, muitas empresas estrangeiras se interessaram em investir no Brasil, certamente considerando o potencial de mercado e de crescimento futuro. Internamente, as elevadas taxas de juros oferecidas para os credores da d\'ivida p\'ublica continuam sendo um fator de desest\'imulo aos investimentos em novos projetos de infraestrutura. No \^ambito federal h\'a um montante mapeado de projetos da ordem de R\$ 200 bilh\~oes em infraestrutura, envolvendo estradas, ferrovias, portos, aero-portos. S\~ao oportunidades que, no entanto, n\~ao devem se desenvolver no curto prazo. Al\'em do aspecto j\'a apontado da elevada taxa de juros, prevalecem outros de incerteza, como a quest\~ao do licenciamento ambiental, que \'e bastante demo-rada, al\'em de entraves burocr\'aticos e administrativos. Portanto, a cria\c{c}\~ao de um ambiente favor\'avel aos investimentos passa pela resolu\c{c}\~ao ou minimiza\c{c}\~ao de todos os aspectos pol\'itico-econ\^omicos apontados, cuja supera\c{c}\~ao poder\'a transformar em oportunidade o que muitas vezes \'e visto apenas como problema, especialmente no que se refere aos gargalos de infraes-trutura e log\'istica.},

Sellers, buyers and banks interact within a computational framework that enables the application of LTV caps to a one-step housing market. We first conduct a simulation exercise; later, we calibrate the probability distributions based on actual European data from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey. In both cases, the application of an LTV cap results in a modified distribution of buyers in terms of property values, bidding prices and properties sold, depending on the probability distributions of the LTV ratio, wealth and debt-to-income ratios considered. The results are of similar magnitude to other studies in the literature embodying other analytical approaches, and they suggest that our methodology can potentially be used to gauge the impact of common macroprudential measures.},

It is based on Naastepad's model, which determines whether the demand-led growth is wage-led or profit-led. Thus, in order to determine the demand regime of the period, we estimated the equations for investment, exports and aggregate propensity to save. Estimating the equations allowed us to calculate the multiplier effect and investment and export elasticity effect. The demand regime in the period was wage-led, mostly due to low participation of investments and exportations in the national income. All equations were estimated by Ordinary Least Squares and showed robust standard deviation of parameters. The statistical tests, carried out after the estimation, suggest an unbiased and consistent model.},

  abstract = {In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2007\textendash 09, political economists have typically identified and interrogated speculative logics and credit-debt relations as the markers of financialized capitalism. This paper argues that assets, and the contingent processes which turn all manner of things into assets (i.e. `assetization'), can also be usefully foregrounded to understand the character and movement of financialized capitalism in the contemporary conjuncture, particularly in its Anglo-American heartlands. Centred on assets and assetization, research is refocused on the constitution of political economies of rent and investment, especially as the frontiers of financialized capitalism are extended to further incorporate nature and society. Research into financialized capitalism is also connected more explicitly to wider political debates over intensified inequalities, as the production and distribution of assets is key to wealth disparities and shapes fundamental stratifications across society.},

Among the schools of thought represented are transaction-cost economics: evolutionary theories: modern 'Austrian' economies: law and economics: reliability theory: and the game-theory approach to the economics of social institutions. The essays are united not by a single topic but by a coherent set of themes - themes best described under the heading of the New Institutional Economics. These include an interest in economic processes as well as in states of equilibrium: a sensitivity to the limits and contours of human rationality: and an emphasis on the various sorts of social institutions that aid and inform economic action. But the essays are not solely methodological or critical. They also include substantive essays that illustrate the New Institutional Economics in practice.},

Money supply shocks are identified empirically from a vector autoregression (VAR) using restrictions that are consistent with a wide class of theoretical models. Using monthly data, I find that money shocks have real effects on the housing market: both real housing prices and housing sales (new starts and existing homes) rise in the short-run in response to positive shocks to the money supply. Simulations of the theoretical model suggest that, for reasonable parameter values, the estimated price responses are generally consistent with the theory.},

  abstract = {The 1990s, especially in the United States, witnessed an unprecedented change in income distribution, with a large redistribution towards rentiers on the one hand, and towards the upper ranks of the managerial bureaucracy on the other hand, as became ever more obvious after the financial scandals affecting large corporations such as Enron and Worldcom. This has also been accompanied by large capital gains that benefited top-file managers as well as shareholders. Ordinary employees and workers, as a counterpart, have seen their real purchasing power stagnate. Despite all this, and in contrast to the predictions of the canonical Kaleckian growth model, many countries achieved respectable growth rates of capital and output. The purpose of the present paper is to explain this paradox and to provide a consistent post-Keynesian model of growth that would model the main features identified above, making a distinction between managerial labour, basically overhead labour, and workers, essentially direct labour - a distinction that was recommended, but never implemented by Kaldor. The model is based on target-return pricing procedures. We then study the implications of cadrisme, a managerial-friendly regime based on large pay packages for the managerial class.},

Although Hodgson considers himself to be a heterodox economist, he complains about the way heterodoxy has been defined by some of its most active thinkers, in particular Frederic Lee and Tony Lawson. Hodgson believes that heterodox economics should be defined neither by a left-leaning ideology nor by critical realism. He argues that too much energy has been devoted to the study of macroeconomics by the Marxist and post-Keynesian brands of heterodox economics, as they left aside what he believes to be the crucial issue of microeconomic behaviour which can be found in behavioural and evolutionary economics. Hodgson further argues that what he considers to be the decline in the impact of heterodox economics is partly due to a lack of quality control. The paper outlines and comments on these various assertions.},

All three points that they make are mistaken: I did not pretend that the introduction of autonomous noncapacity expenditures would on its own allow the neo-Kaleckian growth model to converge toward the normal rate of capacity utilization; the `Keynesian' message is not eliminated when investment expenditures are essentially induced in a neo-Kaleckian model; and the equations that they provide to endogenize the normal rate of capacity utilization are meaningless.},

  abstract = {Sraffians and Kaleckians alike reject the belief that higher rates of accumulation need be associated with lower real wage rates or higher propensities to save. The rejection of this proposition is mainly based on the endogeneity of the rate of capacity utilization, both in the short and the long run. This endogeneity often relies on a discrepancy between the realized and the normal rates of profit, or between the realized and the target rate of capacity utilization, a discrepancy which some authors believe is unwarranted in long run analysis. Various models that eliminate this divergence are outlined. In all these models, the normal rate of profit itself is taken as an endogenous variable. In the first two models, the normal rate of profit depends either on the realized profit rate or the rate of interest. Supply-led results may then reappear in long run analysis. In the last model, one introduces the possibility of a divergence between the rate of return as assessed and targeted by firms, and the rate of return that is actually incorporated into prices. This divergence arises because of the bargaining power of workers and their real wage resistance. Under these conditions, the demand-led results of the Kaleckian tradition are recovered in a model with definite solutions.},

  abstract = {The U.K. and U.S. housing finance systems are two of the world's most efficient. Yet both systems exhibited instability during the past decade, as reflected in high rates of individual borrower and lending institution default. The difficulties stemmed primarily from the combination of macroeconomic policy instability and preexisting housing or financial market constraints. In the United Kingdom, volatility in monetary and fiscal policy interacted with constraints on housing supply and tenure choice to produce a speculative boom and bust in house prices. In the United States, constraints on mortgage contracts led to the insolvency of specialized housing lenders when there was an abrupt change in monetary policy. Three important lessons can be learned from these events. First, important linkages exist among housing markets, the housing finance system, and the broader economy. Second, although liberalization benefits the financial system, it can exacerbate preexisting market distortions. Finally, the benefits of geographic diversification for housing lenders and insurers are significant.},

The comparison includes the types of lenders and mortgage instruments in the primary market, institutions and instruments involved in the capital market funding of mortgages, how loans are funded and how major mortgage risks (default and prepayment) are managed. The paper compares and contrasts the role of government in mortgage market regulation, consumer protection and in the backing of institutions and instruments through guarantees and ownership in the primary and secondary market.

  abstract = {Of the components of GDP, residential investment offers by far the best early warning sign of an oncoming recession. Since World War II we have had eight recessions preceded by substantial problems in housing and consumer durables. Housing did not give an early warning of the Department of Defense Downturn after the Korean Armistice in 1953 or the Internet Comeuppance in 2001, nor should it have. By virtue of its prominence in our recessions, it makes sense for housing to play a prominent role in the conduct of monetary policy. A modified Taylor Rule would depend on a long-term measure of inflation having little to do with the phase in the cycle, and, in place of Taylor's output gap, housing starts and the change in housing starts, which together form the best forward-looking indicator of the cycle of which I am aware. This would create pre-emptive anti-inflation policy in the middle of the expansions when housing is not so sensitive to interest rates, making it less likely that anti-inflation policies would be needed near the ends of expansions when housing is very interest rate sensitive, thus making our recessions less frequent and/or less severe.},

They make predictions about the future, and buy and sell stock as indicated by their expectations of future risk and return. Prices are set endogenously to clear the market. Time series from this market are analyzed from the standpoint of well-known empirical features in real markets. The simulated market is able to replicate several of these phenomenon, including fundamental and technical predictability, volatility persistence, and leptokurtosis. Moreover, agent behavior is shown to be consistent with these features, in that they condition on the variables that are found to be signi"cant in the time series tests. Agents are also able to collectively learn a homogeneous rational expectations equilibrium for certain parameters giving both time series and individual forecast values consistent with the equilibrium parameter values. 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The principal criticism of the theory rests on the determination of the money supply. The supply of money is a dependent variable, not an independent one. The demand for credit determines the quantity of money, or at the very least bankers and borrowers share the responsibility. Causality is thus reversed. It is necessary to abandon the concept of money multipliers, which are relics of the quantity theory of money. Bankers can, if they so desirerespond without limitto demands for credit. They are not tied by a fixed amount of pre-existing assets. The goal of the article is to outline an explanation of these statements and provide a vision of monetary theory that is different from that usually taught.},

In the case of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), so far these issues have been addressed only partly. While general introductions and user's guides for QCA software packages are available, prospective users find little guidance as to how the method works in applied data analysis. How can QCA be used to produce comprehensive, ingenious explanations of social phenomena?In this article, I provide such a hands-on introduction to QCA. In the first two parts, I offer a concise overview of 1. the method's main principles and advantages as well as 2. its vital concepts. In the subsequent part, I offer suggestions for 3. how to employ QCA's analytic tools in the research process and how to interpret their output. Lastly, I show 4. how QCA results can inform the data analysis. As the main contribution, I provide a template for how to reassess cases, causal recipes, and single conditions based on QCA results in order to produce better explanations of what is happening in the data. With these contributions, the article helps prospective QCA users to utilize the full potential the method offers for social science research.URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs1303154},

The degree of persistence in individual regression error, the intercept and trend coefficient are allowed to vary freely across individuals. As both the cross-section and time series dimensions of the panel grow large, the pooled t-statistic has a limiting normal distribution that depends on the regression specification but is free from nuisance parameters. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the asymptotic results provide a good approximation to the test statistics in panels of moderate size, and that the power of the panel-based unit root test is dramatically higher, compared to performing a separate unit root test for each individual time series.},

Based on the theoretical framework of TOE (technology - organization - environment), the paper explores the dynamic mechanism of 81 listed Individual Champions' business model innovation by using the fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) method. The result shows that: Individual Champion' s business model innovation can be attributed to technology-oriented, market-oriented and technology-market-oriented, and Marketoriented business model innovation covers the most enterprises. R\&D investment at the technical level and social networks at the organizational level play an important role in business model innovation. In technology-oriented business model innovation, there is a substitution relationship between technology introduction and R\&D investment. The conclusion of this paper can provide theoretical reference and practical enlightenment for manufacturing enterprises to select and cultivate the driving force of business model innovation.},

  abstract = {This paper incorporates human capital accumulation through provision of universal public education by a balanced-budget government to a Neo-Kaleckian analytical framework of distribution and growth. Human capital accumulation positively impacts on workers\^a\texteuro\texttrademark{} productivity in output production and their bargaining power in wage negotiations. Differences in tax rates on wage and profit income have distributive implications for consumption and investment and so shape how effective demand varies with income distribution. In the long-run equilibrium, a rise in workers\^a\texteuro\texttrademark{} (capitalists\^a\texteuro\texttrademark ) bargaining power raises (lowers) the pre- and after-tax wage share, which raises (reduces) the rates of physical capital utilization, employment (which also measures the rate of human capital utilization) and output growth. Meanwhile, a rise in a uniform tax rate (which also denotes the share of tax spending in public education in output) lowers the long-run equilibrium values of the pre- and after-tax wage share and the rates of physical capital utilization, employment and output growth. Paradoxically, in the long-run equilibrium, a higher share of investment in human capital in output lowers the rate of human capital accumulation, with which output growth varies positively. A strengthening in the bargaining power of workers is output growth-enhancing in the long-run equilibrium, and it does so by raising the rates of accumulation of both physical and human capital.},

  abstract = {We develop a stock-flow consistent model to describe a macroeconomic system consisting of households, firms, the government, the central bank, and banks. The framework is based on the balance sheets of all sectors, in which the monetary flows between them govern the dynamics of the items. The whole system evolves over time and eventually attains a stationary state. Using this integrated model, we find that all flows from banks, including issuing loans, purchasing bonds, paying dividends, and paying interest on deposits, create money. On the contrary, all flows going to banks, including receiving repayments, selling bonds, issuing equities, and receiving interest on loans and bonds, lead to money destruction. These flows associated with the behaviors of money creation and destruction are the core factors that determine stationary states. We show the relationships between these flows and the stationary stock variables, especially the quantity of money. We also present the dependence of final output on these flows. We analyze the effects of monetary policies, such as changing the rate on loans and the amount of bank reserves. We find that an increase in the rate may yield higher output, while injecting more reserves may result in lower output.},

Design/Methodology/Approach: The Granger-Causality bootstrap rolling-window test is used for studying the causality between the stock as well as real estate markets in the US. Findings: The results provide robust evidence that the causality running from the housing in the stock markets has positive effects between 1918 and 1922, 1926 and 1931, 1953 and 1955 but negative effects between 1932 and 1934 and from 1971 to 1972, displaying the occurrence of a credit-price effect. In contrast, the S\&P 500 stomped the housing market between 1965 and 1970, when the wealth effect dominated in the US economy. Specifically, when the negative causality of both markets happens, investors gain by allocating housing and stocks assets as various portfolios. Practical Implications: This finding specifies that housing markets may be employed to predict stock markets and vice versa in the US. Studying both markets' causality offers policymakers and practitioners more situation on where the market may be going and how it works over time. Originality/Value: Original research.},

To determine whether a family is constrained by these criteria, the optimal home purchase price is estimated. The results indicate that wealth and income constraints both reduce homeownership propensities, with a stronger impact for wealth constraints. Mortgage market innovations of the early 1980s seem to have reduced these effects. The research indicates, however, that even in welldeveloped capital markets, the presence of borrowing constraints adversely affects homeownership propensities.},

  abstract = {Purpose From the perspective of cause and effect, the operational processes of property insurance companies can be considered as historical events. The purpose of this study is to measure the operating efficiency of China's property insurance industry, explore the determinants that affect technical efficiency and outline the path to achieving high-quality development. Design/methodology/approach We chose 44 Chinese property insurance companies as research objects. The data were obtained from the Chinese Insurance Yearbook and China Statistical Yearbook 2015\textendash 2017. First, the data envelopment analysis (DEA) method was used to calculate the technical efficiency of property insurance companies. Then, Tobit regression and quantile regression were adopted to explore the influencing factors of technical efficiency. Finally, the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) method was employed to summarize the path to improving the operating efficiency of property insurance companies. Findings The empirical results in the first stage suggested that the operation efficiency of China's property insurance industry was technically inefficient, and the scale efficiency was relatively better than the pure technical efficiency. In the second stage, we observed that the drivers for firm size, reinsurance rate, claim ratio and equity restriction were important determinants of an insurance firm's efficiency. Research limitations/implications We also put forward four applicable, targeted and proven ways to improve the technical efficiency of property insurance companies. These configurations are verified by cases of existing property insurance companies, which can provide practical references for the insurance industry. Originality/value Our research enriches the insurance literature and efficiency methods, particularly regarding the specific paths of improving the technical efficiency. The relationship between elements and results is analyzed from a systematic perspective, and the research results are not only more consistent with what logic might imply but also more instructive for the improvement of reality.},

Second, a shock that moves the land price is capable of generating large volatility in unemployment.

  abstract = {The final model ensures the idea that real estate variables are significantly correlated with GDP growth in Beijing. House pricing and real estate related services are indeed factors associated with GDP growth. The government policies restricting policies housing trade is affecting GDP growth. The regression results support the idea that a raise in real estate prices is correlated with the growth in GDP. However, increasing real estate prices are not always having a good outcome. It is hurting the economic growth in the long-term perspective. Several economists have predicted the collapse of asset prices in China. The primary reason is the unregulated loans given by Chinese banks which will result in a recession. Steps to boost the domestic demand of the Chinese population have to be taken by the Chines leaders. China's economy has an active consumer market which allows China to rely less on the exports and diversifying to other markets. This means that the nation should rely less on companies owned by the states and rely more on private owned companies to be in a competitive environment. President Xi came up with a 2025 economic plan which prioritizing industries like clean-energy, advanced technology, aircraft engine, and big data (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2014.) Raising prices in the real estate market would result in a lack of innovation power since most of the people chose to invest in housing. People put money into real estate that could otherwise go to newly established firms or industrial frontiers. With a lack of money support, firms may find it hard to survive. Also, overly investing in the real estate market will result in an asset bubble. The asset bubble will not only increase the stress of young adults and also increase the chance of potential recession. For further research, studying the real estate cycle of China will be more accurate in showing what exactly happened in China's economic growth.},

  abstract = {While national inequality has made headlines in recent years, income is far more unequally distributed globally than it is within any state. It is striking that global economic inequality has garnered so little attention in International Political Economy (IPE), given the field's longstanding interest in the distribution of resources and the structure of the global economy. This paper argues that IPE should regard the unequal global distribution of wealth and income as a central research concern and outlines a research agenda for doing so. Drawing on recent work by economists, it argues that global inequality is distinctively political in cause and consequence and sufficiently different from both global poverty and national inequality to constitute a unique object of inquiry. IPE has the theoretical and conceptual tools to study global inequality, but doing so will require bridging divisions between those who consider distributional consequences, though primarily in a national perspective, and those concerned with global hierarchies, but with less regard to national agency and economic policymaking. The effort is worth it, however, given the rich substantive agenda that foregrounding global inequality opens up on a series of topics that have not all (to date) been recognized as the core of the field.},

Against the background of increased corporate indebtedness, our interest is in quantifying contagion effects that endogenously arise from corporate defaults in a securitized credit portfolio. We calibrate the model to the U.S., where corporate credit securitization has been reintensified in recent years. Simulations deliver adverse medium- to long-term effects as soon as the share of securitized loans in total new loans economy-wide approaches 10\%. Securitization activities above this threshold lead to significant welfare losses from the medium-term onwards. Two transmission channels are conceivable. A collapsing special purpose vehicle (SPV) either causes distortions in the banking sector or increases liquidity constraints that ultimately dampen households' consumption due to their financial investment in the securitized tranches. A more concentrated banking sector reinforces the adverse shock of a liquidation of the SPV. In contrast, a faster and better-equipped bank rescue mechanism in the form of levies within the banking sector helps to contain the consequences of a SPV collapse.},

Complex Surveys is a practical guide to theanalysis of this kind of data using R, the freely available anddownloadable statistical programming language. As creator of thespecific survey package for R, the author provides the ultimatepresentation of how to successfully use the software for analyzingdata from complex surveys while also utilizing the most currentdata from health and social sciences studies to demonstrate theapplication of survey research methods in these fields.The book begins with coverage of basic tools and topics withinsurvey analysis such as simple and stratified sampling, clustersampling, linear regression, and categorical data regression.Subsequent chapters delve into more technical aspects of complexsurvey analysis, including post-stratification, two-phase sampling,missing data, and causal inference. Throughout the book, anemphasis is placed on graphics, regression modeling, and two-phasedesigns. In addition, the author supplies a unique discussion ofepidemiological two-phase designs as well as probability-weightingfor causal inference. All of the book's examples and figures aregenerated using R, and a related Web site provides the R code thatallows readers to reproduce the presented content. Each chapterconcludes with exercises that vary in level of complexity, anddetailed appendices outline additional mathematical andcomputational descriptions to assist readers with comparing resultsfrom various software systems.Complex Surveys is an excellent book for courses onsampling and complex surveys at the upper-undergraduate andgraduate levels. It is also a practical reference guide for appliedstatisticians and practitioners in the social and health scienceswho use statistics in their everyday work.},

The models covered include vector autoregressive, cointegrated,vector autoregressive moving average, multivariate ARCH and periodic processes as well as dynamic simultaneous equations and state space models. Least squares, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods are considered for estimating these models. Different procedures for model selection and model specification are treated and a wide range of tests and criteria for model checking are introduced. Causality analysis, impulse response analysis and innovation accounting are presented as tools for structural analysis. The book is accessible to graduate students in business and economics. In addition, multiple time series courses in other fields such as statistics and engineering may be based on it. Applied researchers involved in analyzing multiple time series may benefit from the book as it provides the background and tools for their tasks. It bridges the gap to the difficult technical literature on the topic.},

The literature suggests that parties representing the economic `left' are more likely to advocate Keynesian measures, whereas parties representing the economic `right' tend to support the neoliberal ones. However, the current political discourse suggests that the choice of anti-crisis policies rather reflects the conflict of interests between euro states that received a bailout (debtors) and those who only provided financial guarantees (creditors). The empirical findings, based on (1) discourse analysis of national parliamentary debates and (2) the qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) model (crisp set), demonstrate that \textendash{} next to the economic stance of a party \textendash{} receipt of a bailout also accounts for parliamentary parties' positioning on anti-crisis measures. In particular, parliamentary parties in debtor states are likely to opt for Keynesian anti-crisis measures despite their right-wing economic stance or membership in the government.},

  abstract = {Agent-based modelling and simulation (ABMS) is a relatively new approach to modelling systems composed of autonomous, interacting agents. Agent-based modelling is a way to model the dynamics of complex systems and complex adaptive systems. Such systems often self-organize themselves and create emergent order. Agent-based models also include models of behaviour (human or otherwise) and are used to observe the collective effects of agent behaviours and interactions. The development of agent modelling tools, the availability of micro-data, and advances in computation have made possible a growing number of agent-based applications across a variety of domains and disciplines. This article provides a brief introduction to ABMS, illustrates the main concepts and foundations, discusses some recent applications across a variety of disciplines, and identifies methods and toolkits for developing agent models.},

The chapter reviews the cross-national evidence underpinning the emerging story of housingmarket-economy interactions across the advanced economies. It briefly considers whether the reductionism of the understanding developed is too great for many modeling and policy purposes. The chapter suggests ways to progress a better stylized synopsis of housing systems for cross-country modeling, so that housing systems design actually plays some role in explaining housing market outcomes. It considers some of the policy implications of the evidence to date but from the perspective of housing rather than monetary policies and notes emerging future challenges.

This test is based on a very restrictive hypothesis which is rarely ever of interest in practice. The Im\textendash Pesaran\textendash Shin (IPS) test relaxes the restrictive assumption of the LL test. This paper argues that although the IPS test has been offered as a generalization of the LL test, it is best viewed as a test for summarizing the evidence from a number of independent tests of the sample hypothesis. This problem has a long statistical history going back to R. A. Fisher. This paper suggests the Fisher test as a panel data unit root test, compares it with the LL and IPS tests, and the Bonferroni bounds test which is valid for correlated tests. Overall, the evidence points to the Fisher test with bootstrap-based critical values as the preferred choice. We also suggest the use of the Fisher test for testing stationarity as the null and also in testing for cointegration in panel data.},

In this essay, we adopt this metaphor toward the end of contrasting these research traditions across 10 areas: (1) approaches to explanation, (2) conceptions of causation, (3) multivariate explanations, (4) equifinality, (5) scope and causal generalization, (6) case selection, (7) weighting observations, (8) substantively important cases, (9) lack of fit, and (10) concepts and measurement. We suggest that an appreciation of the alternative assumptions and goals of the traditions can help scholars avoid misunderstandings and contribute to more productive ``cross-cultural'' communication in political science.},

Moreover, while demand conditions in general, and speculation in particular, contribute to boom and bust cycles in housing and real estate markets, the impact of speculation is dominated by the effect of the price elasticity of supply. In fact, the large impacts of speculation are only observed when supply is inelastic.},

In a stable case, these 'short-period' warranted rates converge to a unique 'long-period' warranted rate, this being determined independently of the rate of growth of autonomous demand. Thus one has a non-steady path of normal output growth. Different rates of growth of autonomous demand engender, for one and the same configuration of normal income distribution, different paths of normal output growth. Moreover, in a circulating-capital-only model with a given constant rate of growth of autonomous demand, different initial rates of growth in aggregate demand also produce different paths of normal output growth. These results point to the importance of effective demand in capital accumulation.},

  publisher = {{Harvard University Press}},
  abstract = {What determines the rate of growth, the distribution of income, and the structure of relative prices under capitalism? What, in short, makes capitalist economies tick? This watershed treatise analyzes the answers to these questions provided by three major theoretical traditions: neoclassical, neo-Marxian, and neo-Keynesian. Until now, the mutual criticism exchanged by partisans of the different traditions has focused disproportionately on the logical shortcomings of rival theories, or on such questions as whether or not input-output relationships can be described by a continuous-substitution production function. In this book, these are at best secondary issues. The real distinguishing features of the theories, for Stephen Marglin, are their characterization of labor markets and capital accumulation. For clarity, Marglin first sets out the essential features of each theory in the context of a common production model with a single good and a fixed-coefficient technology. He then formalizes the different theories as alternative ways of closing the model. In subsequent chapters he examines the effects of relaxing key simplifying assumptions, in particular the characterization of technology and the homogeneity of output and capital. And although his primary emphasis is theoretical, he does not ignore the problem of empirically testing the theories. Finally, he synthesizes the insights of the neo-Marxian and neo-Keynesian models into a single model that transcends the shortcomings of each taken separately. Marglin anticipates that partisans of the different traditions will agree on one point: each will allow that the book reveals the shortcomings of the other theories but will insist that it fails utterly to reflect the power and majesty of one's own particular brand of truth. Growth, Distribution, and Prices will be controversial, but it will not be ignored.},
