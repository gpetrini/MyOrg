*Note:* This is adapted from [[https://www.alexeyshmalko.com/how-i-note/][Alexey's Brain dump]].

Once a day I process my inbox: literature notes from org-roam, fleeting notes, tasks, and articles from org file.

During the daily review, I retype fleeting notes from my notebook into digital files. (There are little notes per day, so retyping doesnâ€™t bother me.) I maintain a file per resource (book/article/paper/talk).

Articles to read go into my [[id:fe239a69-8d61-4860-b7a3-dece541e79c9][reading inbox]]. Tasks and emails are refiled into [[id:257e67c4-ac7c-489b-b4f3-8420f4b0a5e4][Tasks inbox]]
