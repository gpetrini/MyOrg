* Introduction


This note is an overview of the main Macroeconomic Agent Based Models.
Each of them will be indicated as:
- KS :: [[denote:20250203T180327][Keynes meets Schumpeter Family]]  [cite:@dosi_2010_Schumpeter]
- CATS :: [[denote:20250202T121415][cats_abm_family]]
- EURACE ::
- MMM ::

** Motivation

The purpose of this note is to point the main feature of each model family out, such as:
- What are the drivers of economic growth?
- How non-residential investment is specified?
- Is there any room for [[denote:20250202T114954][Autonomous Expenditures]]?
- Is the model compatible with [[denote:20240708T155553][Effective Demand]]?
- Is it possible to include [[denote:20250202T114928][Asset bubble]]?
- What are the consequences of technological [[denote:20250203T182443][Overinvestment]]?


Considering the objectives of [[denote:20250202T120807][Innovation bubble ABM]] chapter, this note present a [[denote:20250202T120026][Review of Literature]] and check what are the possible improvements to add the [[denote:20250203T184155][Supermultiplier Models]].
Are there any [[denote:20240708T155703][Stylized Facts]]  that this closure replicates?
Is this a more reasonable assumption?
Considering the [[denote:20250203T172959][Dot-Com Crisis]] episode, how this alternative closure deals with [[denote:20240708T155856][Process Innovation]] and [[denote:20240708T155825][Product Innovation]]?

Considering the [[denote:20230216T235207][Chapter ABM]] chapter, this note also examine the possibilities to include the housing sector in those models.

*** Structure

- There are consumption, capital and intermediaries goods sector
  - All firms have the share the same equation but have flags indication to which sector it belongs

*** Production

- Each capital object stores the amount it is capable to produce. Thus, effective production is the sum of this amount.
  - The amount that each capital vintage is capable to produce is restricted to its productive capacity.
  - Each vintage is sorted in descending order
- Capital goods planned production is equal to effective demand for capital goods

*** Investment decision

- Desired expansion investment follow a rigid [[denote:20250202T114158][Accelerator Model]] in which totally adjust current productive capacity to the desired level
  - This occur only if it is the period that firm will invest (called investment period)
  - The desired productive capacity considers expected long term sales
- Effective expansion investment depends on funds and financial assets


*** Pricing

- Unit variable cost is the sum of unit labor cost and input cost
  - The desired price is the desired markup over variable unit cost
- Capital goods price is the average of the capital goods sector
  - Average price is the weighted average of current price by firm's market share
- There is a difference between consumer price index and aggregate price index (GDP deflator)
