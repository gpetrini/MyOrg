* Introduction


This note is an overview of the main Macroeconomic Agent Based Models.
Each of them will be indicated as:
- KS :: [[id:3ff828b3-ceb5-4a18-8ba8-19b647bad967][Keynes meets Schumpeter family]] [cite:@dosi_2010_Schumpeter]
- CATS :: [[id:88dc308c-ddfb-4216-9587-0085cd197621][CATS ABM family]]
- EURACE ::

** Motivation

The purpose of this note is to point the main feature of each model family out, such as:
- What are the drivers of economic growth?
- How non-residential investment is specified?
- Is there any room for [[id:27df9b84-b199-482f-8197-bed51d7f1311][Autonomous Expenditures]]?
- Is the model compatible with [[id:bc6c94e5-1334-4b01-b49c-b98419bd122e][Effective Demand]]?
- Is it possible to include [[id:628bc545-800c-4f2b-beb6-6933d381a2ad][Asset bubble]]s?
- What are the consequences of technological [[id:5901b2ed-90d0-4b76-bafd-2e82d26e0388][Overinvestment]]?


Considering the objectives of [[id:95265264-f61f-4cf5-8cdc-e590b2a47cb9][Innovation bubble ABM]] chapter, this note present a [[id:05b1426c-b748-4858-b937-adb441f10340][Review of Literature]] and check what are the possible improvements to add the [[id:ed384551-c7ba-492f-be69-15906157ef9d][Sraffian suppermultiplier growth model]].
Are there any [[id:8e9dd4a4-0f29-46d1-b8e4-5befe4df94cb][Stylized Facts]] that this closure replicates?
Is this a more reasonable assumption?
Considering the [[id:8d3c092d-8546-4dc0-8a04-55d3d8a09191][Dot-Com crisis]] episode, how this alternative closure deals with [[id:0c6c78fd-8d22-4002-9c82-7ccd82af43f5][Process Innovation]] and [[id:4db8e3cd-585a-435b-ae6a-df903e5bf7af][Product Innovation]]?

Considering the [[id:63b1aea6-c7ca-4d77-8896-b170a907a2ef][Housing Agent Based Model]] chapter, this note also examine the possibilities to include the housing sector in those models.

*** Structure

- There are consumption, capital and intermediaries goods sector
  - All firms have the share the same equation but have flags indication to which sector it belongs

*** Production

- Each capital object stores the amount it is capable to produce. Thus, effective production is the sum of this amount.
  - The amount that each capital vintage is capable to produce is restricted to its productive capacity.
  - Each vintage is sorted in descending order
- Capital goods planned production is equal to effective demand for capital goods

*** Investment decision

- Desired expansion investment follow a rigid [[id:fe75d8ad-4d2a-4c6d-94d4-d55610598944][Accelerator Model]] in which totally adjust current productive capacity to the desired level
  - This occur only if it is the period that firm will invest (called investment period)
  - The desired productive capacity considers expected long term sales
- Effective expansion investment depends on funds and financial assets


*** Pricing

- Unit variable cost is the sum of unit labor cost and input cost
  - The desired price is the desired markup over variable unit cost
- Capital goods price is the average of the capital goods sector
  - Average price is the weighted average of current price by firm's market share
- There is a difference between consumer price index and aggregate price index (GDP deflator)
