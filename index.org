* Welcome

This site is created to track my personal notes.
Since them may have errors, use with caution.
This website is built from my [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode notes]] (managed by [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]]).
The notes are parsed by [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/org/ox-publish.el][ox-publish]] and are exposed using [[https://gitlab.com/OlMon/org-themes/-/tree/master/src/comfy_inline][comfy inline theme]].

* Q&A

** Why in English?
** Why publishing?

The reason is simple: version control with more than one device is hard.
Now, I can access my notes whenever I want easily.
Additional, it make simple to check my files using a cellphone.
Finally, sharing notes helps you learn and makes sure you understand the topic.
