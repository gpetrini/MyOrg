  abstract = {We try to make Keynes' approach compatible with an endogenous theory of the money supply. For that purpose, the principle of liquidity preference is generalized within a competitive banking framework. Private banks can impose a monetary rationing independently of the central bank. Then, we analyse the consequences of a monetary policy shock on the financial behaviour of banks. We clarify the dynamic process between the monetary policy and net investment within a Minskyan approach. First, we build a Post-Keynesian stock-flow consistent model with a private-bank sector introducing more realistic features. Second, we perform some simulations.},

  abstract = {A widespread opinion before the credit crisis of 2007/8 was that securitisation enhances financial stability by dispersing credit risk. After the credit crisis, securitisation was blamed for allowing the 'hot potato' of bad loans to be passed to unsuspecting investors. Both views miss the endogeneity of credit supply. Securitisation enables credit expansion through higher leverage of the financial system as a whole. Securitisation by itself may not enhance financial stability if the imperative to expand assets drives down lending standards. The 'hot potato' of bad loans sits in the financial system on the balance sheets of large banks rather than being sold on to final investors, since the aim of financial intermediaries is to expand lending in order to utilise slack in balance sheet capacity.

  author = {Zhang, Jiayan},
  pages = {72},
  abstract = {The subprime crisis in 2008 was a financial tsunami that affected the whole world. The primary source of the financial crisis was the increase in mortgage defaults, caused by the burst of the housing bubble. Prior to the crisis, the policies for housing mortgages within commercial banks were more relaxed. In the United States, before the subprime crisis, house prices were rising, and the market boomed, with people readily getting loans from commercial banks, without having to provide adequate guarantees. Inadequate risk management of mortgages was a major factor in causing financial disaster.},
