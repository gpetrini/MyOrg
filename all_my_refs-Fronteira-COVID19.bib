It describes the current state of the economy, and the possible channels of transmission that will affect GDP, labor markets and poverty. It summarizes the policy responses carried out by the Argentine government so far and provides some suggestions to minimize the negative impact on employment and poverty. Argentina has entered an early and severe lockdown which has lessened the health sector burden and saved lives. This has seriously deepened the economic crisis Argentina has been suffering since 2018. Compared to other countries in the region, the government has less room to maneuver given its lack of access to international financial markets and compromised fiscal situation.},

We interpret the Covid-19 shock as a shock that reduces utility stemming from ``social'' goods in a two-sector economy with incomplete markets. We compare the advantages of lump-sum transfers versus a credit policy. For the same path of government debt, transfers are preferable when debt limits are tight, whereas credit policy is preferable when they are slack. A credit policy has the advantage of targeting fiscal resources toward agents that matter most for stabilizing demand. We illustrate this result with a calibrated model. We discuss various shortcomings and possible extensions to the model.},

The exact magnitude of this shock to the world economy is uncertain, but many believe that the setback in GDP will be on a scale similar to, if not worse than, the first years of the Great Recession. As such, there is an imperative need for policy actions of a Keynesian nature, as have already been implemented in many countries. In the present paper, with Denmark as a case study, using an SFC modelling approach, some aspects of the negative economic impact of the COVID-19 virus on the Danish economy are highlighted, as are the consequences of the policy actions adopted by the Danish Parliament.},

Following the spread of COVID-19 and increased financial volatility, the growth of FDI and trade outlook for the region in 2020 has been sharply downgraded. This study aims to observe empirically the effect of government spending in heath sectors on economic growth during in the early stage Covid 19 outbreak in Malaysia. As the world has awakened to the potential risks of Covid 19, there has been a massive effort to add capacity to the healthcare system rapidly. In Malaysia, apart from stressing the need for the public to strictly adhere to the Movement Control Order (MCO), the government an immediate boost in funding for healthcare services through initial stage fiscal policy response to Covid 19 outbreak. This research used Dynamic Panel Data also known as longitudinal study, observed data over the four month from December, 2019 to March, 2020 in 5 selected Asia Country that involving with Covid 19. In term of limitation, this study just focusses on four month of data from selected Asia country involved with Covid-19. Panel causality results suggest bidirectional linkages between healthcare sector growth and government spending. Empirical findings suggest that fiscal policy reforms are required to channelize healthcare sector growth to a more government spending resulting from fiscal policy designed by the government of Malaysia. In addition, Panel causality results suggest bidirectional linkages between inward FDI and regulatory quality. Empirical findings suggest that economic policy reforms are required to channelize regulatory quality of COVID-19 to a more foreign capital inflows. The governments of Asian countries should pull out policies on FDI inflows and the environment in order to achieve sustainable economic growth and development. The regulators of other countries should pull out fiscal policies on government policy to achieve sustainable economic growth and health sector growth development.},

  abstract = {We present a System Dynamics (SD) model of the Covid-19 pandemic spread in India. The detailed age-structured compartment-based model endogenously captures various disease transmission pathways, expanding significantly from the standard SEIR model. The model is customized for India by using the appropriate population pyramid, contact rate matrices, external arrivals (as per actual data), and a few other calibrated fractions based on the reported cases of Covid-19 in India. Also, we have explicitly modeled, using independent time-variant levers, the effects of testing, contact tracing, isolating Covid-positive patients, quarantining, use of mask/better hygiene practices, social distancing through contact rate reductions at distinct zones of home(H), work(W), school(S) and other(O) locations. Simulation results show that, even after an extended lock-down, some non-trivial number of infections (even asymptomatic) will be left and the pandemic will resurface. Only tools that work against the pandemic is high rate of testing of those who show Covid-19 like symptoms, isolating them if they are positive and contact tracing all contacts of positive patients and quarantining them, in combination with use of face masks and personal hygiene. A wide range of combination of effectiveness of contact tracing, isolation, quarantining and personal hygiene measures help minimize the pandemic impact and some imperfections in implementation of one measure can be compensated by better implementation of other measures.},
