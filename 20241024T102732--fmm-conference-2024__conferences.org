* Muddy water macro (Fazzari)

- Loanable funds
  - Fallacy: Savers compete to own a greater share of ownership
  - LF is not a teory of interest rate, but it closes the demand gap derived from a "fresh" act to save
    - Consequently, the endogenous interest rate does not closes the demand gap
  - The base interest rate is define at the assets markets
- Fallacy of price adjustment clearing the market
  - The Keynes and Pigou effect stablishes that aggregate demand fall when prices fall
    - This is theoretically ambiguos
  - However, deflation can be destabilizing
    - Debt deflation
    - Lower prices can lead to an expectation on further declines of prices
  - Evidence: Aggregate demand does not change significantly when prices changes
    - Nominal adjustment does not lead to self correction
    - Policy recommendation: avoid deflation at all costs
      - Even maistream authors recognizes that the price deflation is harmfull, which seems logically inconsistent
