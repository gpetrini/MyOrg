  abstract = {Financialization can be characterized as capital switching from the primary, secondary or tertiary circuit to the quaternary circuit of capital. Housing is a central aspect of financialization. The financialization of mortgage markets demands that not just homes but also homeowners become viewed as financially exploitable. It is exemplified by the securitization of mortgage loans, but also by the use of credit scoring and risk-based pricing. In the past century, mortgage markets were transformed from being a `facilitating market' for homeowners in need of credit to one increasingly facilitating global investment. Since mortgage markets are both local consumer markets and global investment markets, the dynamics of financialization and globalization directly relate homeowners to global investors thereby increasing the volatility in mortgage markets, as the current crisis shows all too well.},

Although the quality of the underlying data limits the precision of the estimates, the present paper aims at analysing the fundamental factors behind these evolutions. The analysis presented here assesses whether the observed price dynamics may be attributed to a pure expectation bubble phenomenon or to the large changes in financial and demographic factors. This is done by means of a structural model of the demand and supply sides of the housing market with an error-correction process.When taking into account a standard set of macroeconomic variables, our estimates imply that residential property prices in France and Spain were approximately 20\% above the level explained by their fundamentals by the end of 2008. When demographic and financial factors such as the borrowing capacity are taken on board, the degree of overvaluation is drastically reduced. The adjustment path to equilibrium is slightly faster in France than in Spain, but both countries display significant downward rigidity in prices.},

In addition, a disaggregated approach taking into account several different types of fiscalmeasures highlights that tax and interest rate subsidies are the most efficient fiscal tools for influencing residential investment.When accounting for financial factors by means of households' borrowing capacity, we find that the latter also impacts residential investment positively.Moreover, this alternative specification underlines the robustness of the above mentioned results, as it confirms subsidies as the most efficient measure to influence residential investment.},

We intend to spell out if income inequality was indeed reduced in the latest years. To accomplish that goal, the data for the analysis are issued from Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domic\'ilios (PNAD); also by means of income concentration index, which is divided into 5 features: labor income, pensions and public pensions, private pensions, rents, allowances, grants. In that regard, it covers that Brazilian income inequality jumped from 0.5826 (2002) to 0.5241 (2011). Among other things, from the results obtained is the important fact that by decreasing the parts the income inequality is reduced as a whole, regardless the composition effect is taken to be harmless. The labor income revealed to play an important role in reducing the Gini index by means of effect-concentration (55.83\%), and other incomes, which were responsible for reducing 20.72\%. The rents and pensions officers contributed 18.07\% for reducing the Gini index (G). Furthermore, the effects with respect the other incomes have undoubted influence on the reduction of Brazilian income inequality, especially in the Northeast.},

In this context, one relationship, which still remains unclear, is the relationship between the housing and the labour markets. Some research has been undertaken to support the hypothesis that high rates of homeownership lead to high unemployment via increases in the reservation wage. However, further research is needed to address the possible implications of the institutional settings of the labour market in the dynamics of the housing market. The aim of this paper is to bring some light on the link between both markets. In particular, this contribution explains how the housing cycle could be ``amplified'' via a new channel, that is, economic precariousness, which is closely related to job insecurity. Subsequently, we provide evidence in the case of five developed economies, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, over the period 1985\textendash 2013.},

The central bank should focus on financial stability; for fiscal policy in the short term and in the long term to address demand issues is very important. Interest rate policy should be such that the real rate of interest is in line with trend rate of growth in the economy. Fiscal and monetary policies, though, should be coordinated closely. Major central bank cooperation and intervention in the foreign exchange market is necessary to control the exchange rate. Regional and industrial policies to create the required capacity are important, along with incomes policies, to contain inflationary/deflationary pressures. Distribution of income and wealth is another important policy dimension in view of its importance in terms of the great recession.},

The same OECD study concludes that `The link between house price developments and movements in aggregate demand suggests that monitoring developments in property markets can provide a useful input to the setting of economic policy' (OECD, 2000b, p. 181; see also, Greenspan, 1999).1 The boom of the housing market since the burst of the equity bubble has raised some concerns. Greenspan (2004c) emphasised the importance of `preventive actions' which `are required sooner rather than later' in order to `fend off possible future systemic difficulties, which we assess as likely if GSE expansion continues unabated' (p. 4).2 Especially so, since `the existence, or even the perception, of government backing undermines the effectiveness of market discipline' (p. 4). It is, therefore, suggested that `the GSE regulator must have authority similar to that of the banking regulator', but also `GSEs need to be limited in the issuance of GSE debt and in the purchase of assets, both mortgages and nonmortgages, that they hold' (p. 5).},

We study the impact of the exposure to real estate risk on stock demand. We find that, besides information and transaction costs and risk aversion, housing wealth is a key determinant of stockownership: households facing real estate risk tend to moderate their investments in stocks. This behaviour, called ''temperance'',may thus contribute to explain why people own so few stocks, in particular in France (stock participation puzzle).},

  abstract = {Why has household income in the National Household Survey (PNAD) grown so much faster than household consumption in Brazil's GDP from 2011 to 2012? To provide an answer to this question, we start from a visualization of the importance of the minimum wage in PNAD's income distribution and from a hypothesis that the underestimation of incomes in the PNAD surveys is concentrated in those families whose incomes do not follow the minimum wage. We then derive an equation to explain the difference between household income growth in the PNAD and household consumption growth in the national accounts as a function of the change in the minimum wage. Our empirical estimates of this equation suggest that the behavior of the minimum wage has been an important component in the explanation of differences in income growth between the PNAD and the GDP accounts.},

Differently from life-cycle interpretations of the phenomenon, and from interpretations in terms of erratic deviations of current income flows from their long-run trend, the rising household debt is viewed as the outcome of persistent changes in income distribution and growing income inequalities. Through household debt, low wages appear to have been brought to coexist with relatively high levels of aggregate demand, thus providing the solution to the contradiction between the necessity of high and rising consumption levels, for the growth of the system's actual output, and a framework of antagonistic conditions of distribution which keeps within limits the real income of the vast majority of society. The question of the long-run sustainability of this substitution of loans for wages is finally discussed. Reprinted by permission of Oxford University Press},

We find sound evidence in favour of a cointegrating relation, in which both wealth components display the expected, positive effect on households` consumption. In particular, our results point to a lower marginal propensity to consume out of housing than out of non housing net worth, with a respective size laying in the range of 1.5-2 and 4-6 cents. Following the estimate of a vector error correction model, we discuss the role played by transitory and permanent shocks in driving changes in the variables we consider. We have found that both consumption and wealth respond almost exclusively to permanent shocks, which are the sole determinants of the common stochastic trend in our theoretical set-up. As a result, we are confident that our estimates of wealth coefficients in the cointegrating vector match very closely the true long run marginal propensity to consume for Italian households.},

We analyze the relationship between the personal and the functional income distribution in our sample, before disentangling their effects on the current account. A consistent finding is that rising (top-end) personal inequality leads to a decrease of the current account, controlling for standard current account determinants. By contrast, a fall in the share of wages in national income leads to an increase in the current account. We further analyze how different measures of income distribution affect the financial balances of the household, corporate and government sectors and discuss potential theoretical explanations of our findings. We conclude that changes in personal and functional income distribution have contributed considerably to the widening of current account balances, and hence to the instability of the international economic system, prior to the global financial crisis starting in 2007.},

Each country has a household sector and a non-household (corporate) sector. The household sector is divided into income deciles, and consumer demand is characterized by upward-looking status comparisons following the relative income hypothesis of consumption. The strength of consumption emulation depends on country-speci c institutions. The model is calibrated for the United States, Germany and China. Simulations suggest that a substantial part of the increase in household debt and the decrease in the current account in the United States since the early 1980s can be explained by the interplay of rising (top-end) household income inequality and institutions. On the other hand, the weak domestic demand and increasing current account balances of Germany and China since the mid-1990s are strongly related to shifts in the functional income distribution at the expense of the household sector.},

These discussions took place in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis that is the consequence of the bust of an house price bubble that took place in the US and spread out to most developed countries. Crucial to the success of such policy is the ability of the macro-prudential authority to identify in due time such imbalances, generally featured by asset price boom-bust cycles. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of detecting house price booms according to alternative identification strategies and assess their robustness. In addition, we try to disentangle costless or low-cost from costly house price booms. Resorting both to a non-parametric approach and a discrete-choice (logit) model, we analyze the ability of a set of indicators to robustly explain costly house price booms. According to our results, real long term interest rates, total investment, real credit and real stock prices tend to increase the probability of a costly house price boom.},

Zeroing on the capital account shifts the focus from the goods markets to asset markets and balance sheets. Seen through this lens, the IMFS looks quite different. Its main weakness is its propensity to amplify financial surges and collapses that generate costly financial crises \textendash{} its ``excess financial elasticity''. And assessing the vulnerabilities it hides requires going beyond the residence/non-resident distinction that underpins the balance of payments to look at the consolidated balance sheets of the decision units that straddle national borders, be these banks or non-financial companies. We illustrate these points by revisiting two defining historical phases in which financial meltdowns figured prominently, the interwar years and the more recent Great Financial Crisis.},

Using a Stock-Flow Consistent approach based on the Lotka\textendash Volterra logic, we couple its nonlinear monetary dynamics of underemployment and income distribution with abatement costs. A calibration of our model at the scale of the world economy enables us to simulate various planetary scenarios. Our findings are threefold: 1) the +2 \textdegree C target is already out of reach, absent negative emissions; 2) the longterm (resp. short-term) results of climate change on economic fundamentals may lead to severe economic consequences without the implementation (resp. in case of too rapid an application) of proactive climate policies. Global warming (resp. too fast transition) forces the private sector to leverage in order to compensate for output and capital losses (resp. to lower carbon emissions), thus endangering financial stability; 3) Implementing an adequate carbon price trajectory, as well as increasing the wage share, fostering employment, and reducing private debt make it easier to avoid unintended degrowth and to reach a +2.5 \textdegree C target.},

This view is supported by the results of an econometric study for the USA (1967\textendash 2010), which show that the rise after 1980 in income inequality has made the US economy more profit led.},

This relationship is expressed in two ways: in terms of Marginal Propensity to Consume out of wealth (MPC) and in terms of Elasticity of consumption to wealth. Three concepts of consumption are investigated: total households consumption expenditure, consumption excluding financial services and consumption excluding durable goods. Different estimators are also considered. Based on the MPC approach, when considered as permanent by households, an increase (decrease) in total wealth of one euro would lead to an increase (decrease) of 1 cent in total consumption. In terms of elasticity, an increase (decrease) of 10\% in wealth would imply also a relatively small impact of 0.8 to 1.1\% on consumption depending on the concept of consumption considered. In most cases, the effect of a change in financial wealth is bigger than of a change in housing wealth. The results indicate that the wealth effects in France are smaller than in the UK and US but close to what is observed in Italy. In addition, any deviation of the variables from their common trends is corrected at first by adjustments in disposable income in line with what has been uncovered by studies on Germany and consistent with the ''saving for the rainy days'' approach of Campbell (1987). But our results contrast with the seminal study of Lettau and Ludvigson (2004) in the US where asset prices make the bulk of the adjustment.},

Recently developed econometric techniques for panel unit root testing and heterogeneous panel cointegration analysis are employed. The empirical results provide clear support of a stable long-run relationship between housing investment, non-housing investment and GDP in China. We then estimate the long-run elasticity of GDP with respect to housing investment for the whole country as well as three sub regions. The variations across regions are detected and reasons for this fact are discussed. Based on the panel ECM, we show that there is bidirectional Granger causality between housing investment and GDP in both short run and long run for the whole country, while the impacts of housing investment on GDP behave strikingly differently in the three sub-regions of China.},

The model is estimated and calibrated using global data and simulations are conducted for the period 2016\textendash 2120. Four key results arise. First, by destroying the capital of firms and reducing their profitability, climate change is likely to gradually deteriorate the liquidity of firms, leading to a higher rate of default that could harm both the financial and the non-financial corporate sector. Second, climate change damages can lead to a portfolio reallocation that can cause a gradual decline in the price of corporate bonds. Third, climate-induced financial instability might adversely affect credit expansion, exacerbating the negative impact of climate change on economic activity. Fourth, the implementation of a green corporate QE programme can reduce climate-induced financial instability and restrict global warming. The effectiveness of this programme depends positively on the responsiveness of green investment to changes in bond yields.},

This paper develops a simple macrodynamic model that synthesises some key perspectives of their analytical frameworks. The model incorporates Godley's financial balances approach and postulates that private sector's propensity to spend is driven by a stock-flow norm (the target net private debt-to-income ratio) that changes endogenously via a Minsky mechanism. It also includes two fiscal rules: a Maastricht-type fiscal rule, according to which the fiscal authorities adjust the government expenditures based on a target net government debt ratio; and a Godley\textendash Minsky fiscal rule, which links government expenditures with private indebtedness following a counter-cyclical logic. The analysis shows that (i) the interaction between the propensity to spend and net private indebtedness can generate cycles and instability; (ii) instability is more likely when the propensity to spend responds strongly to deviations from the stock-flow norm and when the expectations that determine the stock-flow norm are highly sensitive to the economic cycle; (iii) the Maastricht-type fiscal rule is destabilising while the Godley\textendash Minsky fiscal rule is stabilising; and (iv) the paradox of debt can apply both to the private sector and the government sector.},

Second, Georgescu-Roegen's distinction between stock-flow and fund-service resources is adopted. Third, output is demand-determined but supply constraints might arise either due to environmental damages or due to the exhaustion of natural resources. Fourth, climate change influences directly the components of aggregate demand. Fifth, finance affects macroeconomic activity and the materialisation of investment plans that determine ecological efficiency. The model is calibrated using global data. Simulations are conducted to investigate the trajectories of key environmental, macroeconomic and financial variables under (i) different assumptions about the sensitivity of economic activity to the leverage ratio of firms and (ii) different types of green finance policies.},

We mainly focus on the ``pandemic`` view of contagion where local shocks, originating from a country or a local housing market, spread out to other domestic housing markets. An interesting finding is that, even allowing for other channels of international transmission (through global interest rates or activity), the US real house prices, which appear to be exogenous in the US dynamics, unidirectionally causes the international house price factor, which in turn causes the domestic real house price growth for several countries. The channels of contagion from the US appears therefore to be either direct, through house prices (in particular in the UK or Spain), or indirect through other variables.},

After Harrod's seminal paper in 1939 they try to unearth the hidden variables that might allow the adaptation of the warranted rate, determined from the supply side, to demand-growth expectations that supposedly have an autonomous source. The purpose of this paper is to show that an investment function based on the accelerator and integrated in a supermultiplier is able to shape the warranted rate in consonance with the autonomous trend. The supermultiplier reveals itself as a stable and stabilising mechanism when demand is split into permanent and transient. Hopefully the paper will build bridges with other Keynesian, Kaleckian and Sraffian strands that have so far dismissed the supermultiplier solution because of its apparently inherent instability.},

We test this hypothesis using aggregate time series data on FHA and conventional mortgage originations. FHA loans are more expensive for borrowers but provide federal guarantees which protect lenders against default losses. For this reason, FHA loans should be subject to easier credit constraints than conventional mortgages, and the FHA share of mortgage originations should increase with aggregate default risk. Default risk is proxied by a bond rate quality spread consistent with previous studies. Our results imply that default risk-induced mortgage rationing persists in the post disintermediation era, but that FHA programs help offset the overall impact of rationing on housing markets.},

This extension term consists of the inflation gap between consumer and house price inflation multiplied by an average loan-to-value ratio and the real house prices. The empirical relevance of our finding is confirmed by a VECM. We provide evidence that the dynamics of residential investment in Germany are significantly influenced by the extended user costs (i.e. basic user costs plus the extension term) as well as by net financial wealth.

It argues that using these models can help heterodox researchers to communicate with mainstream economists and might help to further one's personal academic career, but that such a strategy comes along with the risk of having to accept other, very questionable policy conclusions and of stabilizing the use of the DSGE models in mainstream economics, hence potentially delaying a Kuhnean-type `scientific revolution' in macroeconomics.},

Since this framework examines how variables are determined in equilibrium, second, dynamics behind equilibria are examined, focusing on goods market and labor market changes.

  abstract = {The relationship between co-integration and error correction models, first suggested in Granger (1981), is here extended and used to develop estimation procedures, tests, and empirical examples. If each element of a vector of time series x\textsubscript{t} first achieves stationarity after differencing, but a linear combination {$<$}tex-math{$>\$\backslash$}alpha \^\{\textbackslash prime \}x\_\{t\}\${$<$}/tex-math{$>$} is already stationary, the time series x\textsubscript{t} are said to be co-integrated with co-integrating vector {$\alpha$}. There may be several such co-integrating vectors so that {$\alpha$} becomes a matrix. Interpreting {$<$}tex-math{$>\$\backslash$}alpha \^\{\textbackslash prime \}x\_\{t\}=0\${$<$}/tex-math{$>$} as a long run equilibrium, co-integration implies that deviations from equilibrium are stationary, with finite variance, even though the series themselves are nonstationary and have infinite variance. The paper presents a representation theorem based on Granger (1983), which connects the moving average, autoregressive, and error correction representations for co-integrated systems. A vector autoregression in differenced variables is incompatible with these representations. Estimation of these models is discussed and a simple but asymptotically efficient two-step estimator is proposed. Testing for co-integration combines the problems of unit root tests and tests with parameters unidentified under the null. Seven statistics are formulated and analyzed. The critical values of these statistics are calculated based on a Monte Carlo simulation. Using these critical values, the power properties of the tests are examined and one test procedure is recommended for application. In a series of examples it is found that consumption and income are co-integrated, wages and prices are not, short and long interest rates are, and nominal GNP is co-integrated with M2, but not M1, M3, or aggregate liquid assets.},

The existence of common housing cycles among the countries of the euro zone could lead the European Central Bank to integrate more specifically the evolution of such asset prices in its assessment. In this paper, we implement a multivariate unobserved component model on housing market variables in order to assess the common euro area housing cycle and to evaluate its relationship with the economic cycle. Among the general class of multivariate unobserved component models, we implement the band-pass filter based on the trend plus cycle decomposition model and we allow the existence of two cycles of different periods. The dataset consists of gross domestic product and real house prices series for four main euro area countries (Germany, France, Italy and Spain). Empirical results show a strong relationship for business cycles in France, Italy and Spain. Moreover, French and Spanish house prices cycles appear to be strongly related, while the German one possesses its own dynamics. Finally, we find that GDP and house prices cycles are related in the medium-term for fluctuations between 4 and 8 years, while the housing market contributes to the long-termeconomic growth only in Spain and Germany},

Interestingly, this result is robust to the various considered approaches. Moreover, it seems that the housing sector long-term trend possesses its own dynamics, quite different from the aggregate French economic activity. Thus, in a second part, we review various structural factors that could drive housing market developments in France in the future.},

The basic message is that non-wage sources of effective demand, based on mortgage and consumer credit, can play a key role in inducing capacity investment and driving long-run output growth. This article gives a broad overview of the role of financed-induced semi-autonomous expenditures in growth, cycles and crises, and thus criticizes some of the previous approaches that claim to mimic actual cycles while abstracting from these crucial determinants of economic activity.},

  abstract = {According to the Sraffian supermultiplier model, economic growth is driven by the autonomous components of aggregate demand (exports, public spending and autonomous consumption). This paper tests empirically some major implications of the model. For this purpose, we calculate time-series of the autonomous components of aggregate demand and of the supermultiplier for the US, France, Germany, Italy and Spain and describe their patterns in recent decades. We observe that changes in output and in autonomous demand are tightly correlated, both in the long and in the short-run. The supermultiplier is substantially higher and more stable in the US, while in the European countries it is lower and strongly decreasing. Consistently with theory, we find that where the supermultiplier is reasonably stable - i.e., in the US since the 1960s - autonomous demand and output share a common long-run trend (i.e, they are cointegrated). The estimation of a Vector Error-Correction model (VECM) on US data suggests that autonomous demand exerts a long-run effect on GDP, but also that there is simultaneous causality between the two variables. We propose an explanation based on the idea that autonomous demand is socially and historically determined. We then estimate the multiplier of autonomous spending through a panel instrumental-variables approach, finding that a one dollar increase in autonomous demand raises output by 1.6 dollars over four years. A further implication of the model that we test against empirical evidence is that increases in autonomous demand growth tend to be followed by increases in the investment share. Through Granger-causality tests and instrumental variables analysis, we find that this is the case in all five countries. An additional 1\% increase in autonomous demand raises the investment share by 0.57 percentage points of GDP in the long-run},

  abstract = {This paper looks at the effect of demand shocks on the investment share of the economy. Using panel data on 20 OECD countries, we show that the rate of growth of autonomous demand (exports, public spending and housing investment) is positively correlated with subsequent values of the share of business investment in GDP. By means of an instrumental-variables strategy, we confirm a positive effect of demand dynamics on the business investment share. We instrument autonomous demand with US demand for imports interacted with exposure to trade with the US, openness to trade of a country's main export destinations, and military spending. A permanent 1\% increase in autonomous demand growth raises the investment share by 1.5 to 1.9 percentage points of GDP in our preferred panel IV specification. Our results provide empirical support for the view that the influence of aggregate demand on capital accumulation can be a major source of hysteresis. Our results are inconsistent with the canonical New Keynesian 3-equations model, the Neo-Kaleckian model with flexible equilibrium utilization and Classical-Marxian growth models. A positive influence of autonomous demand on the investment share is instead compatible with demand-led models in which capacity adjusts to demand in the long-run.},

The model is built on the post-Keynesian view of a monetary production economy with creditor-debtor relationships and the endogeneity of the volume of credit and the stock of money. The model contains distribution conflict between firms and workers which will determine the wage and profit shares and may generate conflict inflation, and distribution conflict between rentiers (creditors) and firms (debtors) mainly affected by interest rate policies of the central bank and by (unexpected) inflation generated in the distribution conflict between workers and firms. The model generates a short-run `inflation barrier', which becomes endogenous to demand determined employment and macroeconomic policies in the long run. Based on the model we will provide a full post-Keynesian macroeconomic policy mix as an alternative to the New Consensus Macroeconomics. In this alternative policy package monetary policy should target low long-run real interest rates, take over responsibility for financial stability, and act as a lender of last resort and a guarantor of government debt. Nominal stabilisation should be addressed by income and wage policy, in particular through mediation of distributional conflicts via wage bargaining co-ordination. Real stabilisation and aggregate demand management, both in the short and in the long run, should be the task of fiscal policy, making use of government deficits/surpluses following a `functional finance' approach.},

  abstract = {Fluctuations in the housing market have long been recognized by academics and practitioners as leading indicators of general economic activities. Recently, Leamer (2007, 2015) claims that housing activities both predict and cause national business cycles in the US. We investigate his claims for a larger set of countries. We also examine the predictive relationship in multiple resolutions or time scales, namely shortrun and long-run variations of business cycles. Structural vector auto-regression (SVAR) models are estimated to test his more contentious causal claim. Our results show that: (1) housing indicators lead business cycles in most countries; (2) such leading relationship is the most prominent in the long-run. In addition, our SVAR results for the US indicate that housing factors are likely independent drivers of business cycles. Housing starts predict short-run variations in business cycles, while housing prices predict long-run variations better. The cross-country evidences are less certain. Generally, our findings on timescale based relationships between housing and macro economy put restrictions on future models of monetary transmissions.},

We show that the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator is mixed Gaussian. Once a certain eigenvalue problem is solved and the eigenvectors and eigenvalues calculated, one can conduct inference on the cointegrating rank using some nonstandard distributions, and test hypotheses about cointegrating relations using the {$\chi$} \textsuperscript{2} distribution.},

Despite sound fundamentals and a substantial reduction in its traditional external vulnerabilities, the Brazilian real has been one of the most volatile currencies over recent years. The article argues that this has been the result of the surging exposure of foreign investors in an increasingly complex set of very short-term domestic currency assets. Following a Minskyan analysis, we demonstrate that the changing nature of Brazil's external vulnerability confirms both the inherent and endogenous instability of international capital flows and DECs' subordinate role in the international financial system. We conclude with policy recommendations to reduce DECs' external vulnerability sustainably.},

This paper presents an agent-based model (ABM) to model the housing market from 1986 to 2017. We provide a unique approach to simulating the financial market along with analyzing the phenomenon of emergence resulting from the interactions among consumers, banks and the Federal Reserve. This paper specifically focuses on the emergence of ``underwater mortgages'' and the macroeconomics of the housing market. The market value of a property is heavily influence by the value of a neighboring property; therefore, individuals are able to gauge the probable value of a property that has not been developed yet. The blend of available financial products to consumers (i.e., ARM versus Fixed-Rate) certainly influences demand within the housing market given that ARM products are more affordable than fixed-rate products. Policymakers and financial institutions should work together to develop programs, which monitor the supply of these historically easy to access financial products and prevent the risk of underwater mortgages and crashes.},

This evidence is consistent with a model where the trend in housing demand is determined by demographic factors and economic well-being to which supply adjusts so slowly that real house prices are affected persistently. Reunification seems to have induced two structural changes in the empirical housingmarketmodel. First, the speed of equilibriumadjustment via residential investment slowed down substantially and real house prices lost the capacity to contribute to the adjustment process. Second, the degree of persistence in the error correction term increased a lot. The changing features are key to explain significant differences in alternative trend-cycle decompositions of residential investment.},

Since World War II we have had eight recessions preceded by substantial problems in housing and consumer durables. Housing did not give an early warning of the Department of Defense Downturn after the Korean Armistice in 1953 or the Internet Comeuppance in 2001, nor should it have. By virtue of its prominence in our recessions, it makes sense for housing to play a prominent role in the conduct of monetary policy. A modified Taylor Rule would depend on a long-term measure of inflation having little to do with the phase in the cycle, and, in place of Taylor's output gap, housing starts and the change in housing starts, which together form the best forward-looking indicator of the cycle of which I am aware. This would create pre-emptive anti-inflation policy in the middle of the expansions when housing is not so sensitive to interest rates, making it less likely that anti-inflation policies would be needed near the ends of expansions when housing is very interest rate sensitive, thus making our recessions less frequent and/or less severe.},

As creator of thespecific survey package for R, the author provides the ultimatepresentation of how to successfully use the software for analyzingdata from complex surveys while also utilizing the most currentdata from health and social sciences studies to demonstrate theapplication of survey research methods in these fields.The book begins with coverage of basic tools and topics withinsurvey analysis such as simple and stratified sampling, clustersampling, linear regression, and categorical data regression.Subsequent chapters delve into more technical aspects of complexsurvey analysis, including post-stratification, two-phase sampling,missing data, and causal inference. Throughout the book, anemphasis is placed on graphics, regression modeling, and two-phasedesigns. In addition, the author supplies a unique discussion ofepidemiological two-phase designs as well as probability-weightingfor causal inference. All of the book's examples and figures aregenerated using R, and a related Web site provides the R code thatallows readers to reproduce the presented content. Each chapterconcludes with exercises that vary in level of complexity, anddetailed appendices outline additional mathematical andcomputational descriptions to assist readers with comparing resultsfrom various software systems.Complex Surveys is an excellent book for courses onsampling and complex surveys at the upper-undergraduate andgraduate levels. It is also a practical reference guide for appliedstatisticians and practitioners in the social and health scienceswho use statistics in their everyday work.},

The results of the evaluation show that the demand components have permanent effects in the long run and that there is a positive causality from final demand autonomous components towards the product. Furthermore, an estimate of both the short and the long run dynamics through an Error-Correction Model is presented. Most empirical studies in which income is determined by demand work with exports-led model \`a la Thirlwall (1999, 2000). Instead, not only the exports but also both the government and the non-salaried private expenditures are included in this article.},

The results tend to show significant and positive cointegration between these two variables, thus giving support to the BPC-model as a relevant hypothesis to explain Mexico's long-term economic growth. Moreover, the findings of cointegration tests for selected subperiods suggest that the slowdown in its economic growth since 1982 is associated with an increase in the long-term income elasticity of imports that made more binding the balance-of-payments constraint on the expansion of domestic output.},

We introduce the general features of the SFC approach for a closed economy, showing how the core model has been extended to address issues such as financialization and income distribution. We next discuss the implications of the approach for models of open economies and compare the methodologies adopted in developing SFC empirical models for whole countries. We review the contributions where the SFC approach is being adopted as the macroeconomic closure of microeconomic agent-based models, and how the SFC approach is at the core of new research in ecological macroeconomics. Finally, we discuss the appropriateness of the name `SFC' for the class of models we survey.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between construction activity and economic development at the provincial level in the Peoples' Republic of China. It also examines variations in the mix of construction outputs among the provinces as they achieve increasing levels of development. It is argued that the analysis of provincial construction outputs and levels of economic development provides additional insights into the debate on the wider relationship between construction activity and economic development as posited by Turin in his seminal studies during the 1960s and 1970s. Since these seminal works many researchers have also sought to explain the relationship between construction activity and economic development. Turin's model is of this relationship and although some studies only provide qualified support for this hypothesis, it is generally agreed that there is a causal link between construction activity and economic development within countries as they develop their economies. Most of these studies have been based on the use of international cross-sectional data from countries at different stages of development to infer an assumed relationship within an individual country over time. In this study, similar data are analyzed to examine these relationships at the provincial level within a large country, each of these provinces being at significantly differing levels of development. Since it adopted policies of economic reform in the late 1970s, China has realized considerable economic progress. However, this has varied significantly among the provinces and regions. Consequently, data demonstrating developments in China's wider economy and its construction activity at the provincial level can be used to test the applicability of the Turin hypothesis within a country that has undergone significant developments over such a short period of time.},

Concerns related to supply, particularly at the higher segment of the market, lead these discussions. In this respect, basic regression estimations indicate that over the post-2010 period, income elasticity of house price changes is negative, despite housing being a normal good. In order to reveal the underlying reason, we discuss the role of income distribution. Our empirical analyses suggest that the share of bottom (the top) income quintiles are positively (is negatively) correlated with house price changes. Given the current ample stock of houses, at the high-end of the market, a demand surge led by an increase in the income share of the top income quintile may not put pressure on house prices. In addition, the declining income share of bottom three income quintiles may lead to a reduction in their housing demand. Thus, policies directed to improving income equality might help mitigate the imbalances in the housing market.},

The crisis occurred just as the surge in housing starts that began in the late 1990s had reached a new historical zenith. This chapter explains the impact of the credit crunch on the Spanish housing market and in particular examines the evidence about how new supply reacted to the external shock. In support of this task it compares and contrasts housing supply elasticities in different Spanish regions over time. The analysis maintains that the strong expansion on housing supply was possible due to the flexibility of the development sector showing a high elasticity of new housing supply. Such flexibility it is argued is also the reason for the strong fall in housing construction as well as the tiny reduction in prices following the financial crisis.},

  abstract = {One of the earliest works on the economic significance of the construction industry and its role within the national economy was undertaken by Duccio A. Turin, then London Master Builders' Association Professor of Building at the Building Economics Research Unit, University College London. The quantitative relationships between construction and other important indicators of economic development were depicted for the first time by Turin in 1969. This has since then become one of the most frequently quoted works on the subject. Turin's findings were also adopted subsequently by major international agencies assigned with the task of resolving the problem of underdevelopment in the developing countries. Since Turin's studies some two decades ago, there has so far been no attempt to update the construction-development paradigm along the same format using statistical data sourced from the 1970s and 1980s. For the past 20 years most researchers appear to have assumed that Turin's findings will be `more-or-less' valid. While this supposition may be true to a certain extent, there will inevitably be some discrepancies when Turin's findings are analysed in the modern day context, where technological innovations and the completion of most of the required buildings and infrastructural facilities are expected to exert an influence on the existing relationship between construction and economic development. While this relationship still appears to be valid today, the degree or intensity with which construction and development link may, however, shift from the original quantitative models suggested by Turin. The extent of this suggested shift over time is, however, unknown despite the large number of research studies which have purportedly explored the relationship between construction and economic development over the last two decades. In view of this lacuna, this paper will attempt to replicate Turin's original paradigm for construction and development using data sourced from the 1970s and 1980s.},

Furthermore, we provide a multi-faceted picture of wealth distribution in Europe using the socio-economic characteristics available in the HFCS, and we show that inheritances are the single most important factor for wealth inequality. The structural power to shape economic and political institutions is thus ever more concentrated. Finally, we discuss three channels through which the unequal distribution of private assets may affect power relations and economic activity.},

Symptoms can go from benign to large asset price bubbles and excess credit creation, which are among the best predictors of financial crises.

O termo 'gasto improdutivo' ser\'a usado neste trabalho para designar todas as despesas que ajudam a realizar (vender) o produto da economia mas n\~ao criam capacidade produtiva, menos a parte da folha salarial que retorna " automaticamente " ao conjunto das empresas e que representa o consumo induzido dos trabalhadores. 1 Como estamos interessados no papel macroecon\^omico do gasto improdutivo, vamos interpretar esta categoria de gastos num sentido amplo, independente de sua forma espec\'ifica ou do agente ou institui\c{c}\~ao que o efetue. 2 * O autor agradece o apoio financeiro do CNPq e a Fabio Freitas e Carlos Medeiros por in\'umeras discuss\~oes sobre o tema. ** do IE-UFRJ 1 Como os economistas cl\'assicos usualmente supunham que os trabalhadores n\~ao poupavam estes gastos eram com frequ\^encia referidos como gasto improdutivo do excedente. No entanto, quando levamos em conta a possibilidade de poupan\c{c}a dos trabalhadores e que estes tamb\'em podem financiar seu consumo atrav\'es do cr\'edito ou alguma riqueza acumulada fica melhor utilizar o termo mais geral 'gasto improdutivo'. 2 Isso significa que ser\~ao considerados gasto improdutivo para os prop\'ositos deste artigo todos os gastos p\'ublicos (inclusive em investimento pois n\~ao criam diretamente capacidade produtiva para o setor privado), todas as exporta\c{c}\~oes (inclusive de bens de capital, pois n\~ao criam capacidade para a economia que os exporta), o consumo financiado por cr\'edito ou pela riqueza, tanto de propriet\'arios quanto de trabalhadores e tamb\'em alguns gastos que com frequ\^encia s\~ao considerados investimento privado mas n\~ao criam capacidade produtiva como despesas empresariais em geral e em pesquisa \& desenvolvimento e em particular boa parte da constru\c{c}\~ao civil que configura em investimento residencial (compra de im\'oveis para resid\^encia). Esta classifica\c{c}\~ao corresponde ao que Garegnani(1962) chamou de 'demanda final' menos o consumo induzido da folha salarial.},

Sources and uses of incomes are disaggregated by household groups including the top 1 percent. Their importance (including saving rates) differs markedly across households. The SAM reveals two transfer flows exceeding 10 percent of GDP via fiscal (broadly progressive) and financial (regressive) channels. A third major flow over time has been a ten percentage point increase in the GDP share of the top 1 percent. A simulation model is used to illustrate how `feasible' modifications to tax/transfer programs and increasing low wages cannot offset the historical redistribution toward the well-to-do.},

Using a pre-sale as a mechanism of updating a developer's beliefs, this paper analyzes the impact of over-confidence on overbuilding and cycles in real estate markets. Our finding indicates that a pre-sale activity will increase the magnitude of over-building and over-confidence will increase the volatility in real estate markets. Our model also has implications to the well-established literature dealing with the issue of over-capacity in many industrial sectors.},

Therefore, the German housing system is considered to be operating outside financialized capitalism. Despite Germany's apparent stability, we argue that an alternative trajectory of financialization in the German housing market can be observed. This trajectory has followed three stages or `waves'. The first wave started around the time of German unification and is characterized by the failed attempt of West German banks to marketize and liberalize German housing finance. The second wave started in the late 1990s and is characterized by the `financialized privatization' of many public housing associations and the speculative investments of private equity firms and hedge funds. The third wave started during the global financial crisis and is characterized by booming housing prices and the market entry of listed real estate companies.},
