  abstract = {Many researchers have studied the adverse impacts of the negative supply shock due to measures taken to combat the spread of COVID-19. This column provides estimates of occupation- and industry-specific effects of both the supply and the demand shock~for the US. US GDP is predicted to decline by 22\% compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, and 24\% of US jobs are likely to be vulnerable. The adverse effects are further estimated to be strongest for low-wage workers who might face employment reductions of up to 42\% while high-wage workers are estimated to experience a 7\% decrease.},
