  abstract = {Purpose The aim of this paper is to assess whether the inclusion of the rental housing market affect the dynamics of the real business cycles (RBCs). Design/methodology/approach For this investigation, the authors model and estimate two dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) versions for the US economy, one with and one without the presence of residential rent. Findings The findings provide evidence that the inclusion of the rental housing market can improve the assessment of public policies and the projection of scenarios in the face of sudden macroeconomic shocks. The addition of this secondary housing market augments the effect of total factor productivity (TFP) shock on output and consumption. In addition, it increases the effect of the credit shock on the demand for housing. The latter highlights the role of credit for the real estate market. Therefore, the authors recommend that analysts and macro-prudential authorities consider adding it to their models. Originality/value The findings provide evidence that the inclusion of the rental housing market can improve the assessment of public policies and the projection of scenarios in the face of sudden macroeconomic shocks.},

  abstract = {Since the onset of the Global Financial Crisis, the presence of institutional investors in housing markets has steadily increased over time. Real estate funds (REIFs) and other housing investment firms leverage large-scale buy-to-rent investments in real estate assets that enable them to set prices in rental housing markets. A significant fraction of this funding is being provided in the form of non-bank lending (i.e., lending that is not subject to regulatory LTV limits). I develop a quantitative two-sector DSGE model that incorporates the main features of the real estate fund industry in the current context to study the effectiveness of dynamic LTV ratios as a macroprudential tool. Despite the comparatively low fraction of total property and debt held by REIFs, optimized LTV rules limiting the borrowing capacity of such funds are more effective in smoothing property prices, credit and business cycles than those affecting (indebted) households \textendash{} borrowing limit. This finding is remarkably robust across alternative calibrations (of key parameters) and specifications of the model. The underlying reason behind such an important and unexpectedly robust finding relates to the strong interconnectedness of REIFs with various sectors of the economy.},
