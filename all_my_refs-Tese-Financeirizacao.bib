  abstract = {The current crisis confirmed that highly financialized regimes of accumulation are extremely crisis-prone. Most of the literature on financialization is focused on the economies of the centre. This paper analyses the peculiarities of financialization in the periphery, which is characterized by a high degree of extraversion and/or by considerable socio-economic heterogeneity. The theory of regulation permits analysis of different forms of financialization and the social dynamics linked with them. In contrast to Keynesian approaches, the state, international organizations and social forces shaping norms and policies are an explicit part of the theory. This allows for looking at policy-making within the analysis. Such an analysis enables us to explain policy changes (or lack of them) that are crucial for the processes of financialization and de-financialization in the periphery.},

This paper reached three conclusions: first, housing financialization and land financialization cannot be separated in China; housing financialization boosts the demand for housing assets and land financialization speeds up the supply to meet the demand. Second, housing financialization and land financialization jointly expand the production of properties and sustain capital accumulation. Third, the financialization of land and housing evolve over time. We conclude that the separate and related processes of housing and land financialization in China reflect the unique characteristics of the state ownership of land in China.},

Household debt to asset ratios have risen substantially in many countries. Financial stability risks have been increasingly linked to real estate lending booms which are typically followed by deeper recessions and slower recoveries. Housing finance has come to play a central role in the modern macroeconomy.},

This paper argues that assets, and the contingent processes which turn all manner of things into assets (i.e. `assetization'), can also be usefully foregrounded to understand the character and movement of financialized capitalism in the contemporary conjuncture, particularly in its Anglo-American heartlands. Centred on assets and assetization, research is refocused on the constitution of political economies of rent and investment, especially as the frontiers of financialized capitalism are extended to further incorporate nature and society. Research into financialized capitalism is also connected more explicitly to wider political debates over intensified inequalities, as the production and distribution of assets is key to wealth disparities and shapes fundamental stratifications across society.},

  abstract = {Over the past decades, the financial investment of non-financial businesses has been rising, and the accumulation of capital goods has been declining. The first part of the paper offers a novel theory to explain this phenomenon. Financialisation, the shareholder revolution and the development of a market for corporate control have shifted power to shareholders and thus changed management priorities, leading to a reduction in the desired growth rate. In the second part, the link between accumulation and financialisation is tested econometrically by means of a time series analysis of aggregate business investment for the USA, the UK, France and Germany. Extensive tests of robustness are performed. For the first three countries, evidence supporting the negative effect of financialisation on accumulation is found.

  abstract = {Based on the conceptual framework of neoliberal and post-neoliberal governance, this study explores the changing financial governance under the real estate boom-bust cycle in Ordos City, China. It finds that Ordos City's neoliberal financial governance, featuring excessive deregulation, active public\textendash private partnerships, market-friendly and growth-chasing institutional restructuring, land financialization, and enthusiastic state investment, has significantly contributed to the city's real estate boom and overbuilding. In Ordos City's post-bubble period, although preferential financial policies and deregulation persist, neoliberal financial governance has been largely curbed through reinforced governance and enhanced welfare and redistributive policy efforts such as the Housing Exchange Program. This article reiterates the essence of China's neoliberal governance and verifies the existence of neoliberal governance in Ordos City. It also showcases the resilience of neoliberal local governing strategies in China. Nevertheless, the post-neoliberal endeavors in Ordos City, characterized by reinforced welfare and redistributive measures, and timely and effective state intervention via rigorous governance and enhanced public ownership of real estate assets for redistribution, add critical insights to the global intellectual and practical quests for post-neoliberal possibilities. Finally, this study calls for combined efforts of sustainable development policy initiatives, effective policy implementation, rigorous governance, and a mindset of sustainability for all to combat neoliberalism.},
