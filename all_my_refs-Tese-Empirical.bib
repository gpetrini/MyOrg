  abstract = {This paper examines how the liability side of Islamic banks is impacted by the risk in the macro economy. The paper first develops theoretical models for conventional and Islamic banks. For conventional banks, we argue that during periods of rising risk in the economy, investors with higher risk aversion prefer bank deposits as a haven compared to other asset classes, causing conventional banks to be flushed with excess liquidity, which is then disposed of in the form of risky loans. This may create asset price bubbles and a further increase in the overall risk of the economy. For Islamic banks, we build a theoretical model with a religious conscious customer base who demands products with religious compliance. The increased self-regulatory environment faced by Islamic banks on the backdrop of religious compliance helps reducing the influx of liquidity and conversion into risky loans during periods of heightened macroeconomic shocks. Using bank-level data from 20 Muslim-dominated countries for the period from 2000 to 2015, we test the propositions of our theoretical model. We find that the macroeconomic risk has a significant, positive impact on conventional bank deposits, while its impact on Islamic banks' deposits is either negative or significantly lower than their conventional counterparts.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a large-scale Canadian macroeconomic database and shows its usefulness for empirical macroeconomic analysis. The dataset contains hundreds of Canadian and provincial economic indicators. It is designed to be updated regularly and real-time vintages are publicly available. It relieves users to deal with data changes and methodological revisions. We show four useful features of this dataset for macroeconomic research. First, the factor structure explains a sizeable part of variation the dataset and appears as an appropriate mean of dimension reduction. Second, the dataset is useful to capture turning points of the Canadian business cycle. Third, it has substantial predictive power when forecasting key macroeconomic indicators. Fourth, the richness of the panel is used to study the effectiveness of monetary policy across regions and sectors.},

  abstract = {Interconnected capital markets allow mobile global capital to flow into immobile local assets. This paper examines how foreign demand affects U.S. housing markets, and uses this demand shock to estimate local price elasticities of supply. Other countries introduced foreign-buyer taxes meant to deter Chinese housing investment beginning in 2011. We first show house prices grew 8 percentage points more in U.S. zipcodes with high foreign-born Chinese populations after 2011, subsequently reversing with the onset of the U.S.\textendash China trade war. Second, we use international tax policy changes as a U.S. housing demand shock and estimate local house price and quantity elasticities with respect to international capital. We find that a 1\% increase in instrumented foreign capital raises house prices at the zip code level by 0.27\%, and housing supply by 0.004\%. Finally, we use the two elasticities to construct new local house price elasticities of supply for the largest 100 CBSAs. These supply elasticities average 0.1 and vary between 0.02 and 0.7, suggesting that local housing markets are inelastic in the short run and exhibit substantial spatial heterogeneity.},
