* Introduction

This note contains an overview of the literature about [[denote:20250202T121158][Expectations]] formation and some discussion on [[denote:20250202T115203][Behavioral Finance]].
The idea is to summarize some conclusions to be further utilized in the [[denote:20250202T120807][Innovation bubble ABM]] chapter.
This note focus on firm's expectation formation and extend to financial markets when not available.


** Motivation

At the current stage (<2021-12-15 qua>), my motivation is to report whether firms have some sort of [[denote:20250202T115214][Behavior Bias]] when forming their expectations.
The empirical reason for this is to mimic some pattern during the [[denote:20250203T172959][Dot-Com Crisis]] in which high-tech firms experienced [[denote:20250203T182443][Overinvestment]], leading to an [[denote:20250202T114928][Asset bubble]] related to the innovation process.

* Theoretical findings

- [[denote:20250203T175849][Information Rigidity Models]] and [[denote:20250202T113854][Inatention Models]] provide theoretical support for agents not be attentive to all information available [cite:@coibion_2018_How]
  - Thus, it is related to [[denote:20250203T180559][Learning and Heuristics]] literature in which agents do not process all information in a [[denote:20240708T111511][Complex system]]
  - In other words, agents intentionally limit the number of variables they track
- A [[denote:20250202T115151][Behavioral extrapolation]] heuristic is the most parsimonious way to estimate expectations [cite:@gennaioli_2016_Expectations]
  - At odds with information rigidity models, its is not reasonable to assume that agents will not be attentive to their past expectations
- [[denote:20250202T115214][Behavior Bias]] models associate deviations from the [[denote:20250203T173614][Fundamentals]] as a results of a [[denote:20250202T121632][cognitive_restriction]]. Thus, those models assume that agents are [[denote:20250202T115256][Boundedly Rational]].
- Only [cite/t:@demarzo_2007_Technological] investigate the relation between [[denote:20250202T114928][Asset bubble]] and [[denote:20250203T182443][Overinvestment]] even when investments are not profitable
  - They present a [[denote:20250202T121100][General Equilibrium Model]] in which a [[denote:20250202T120107][Relative Wealth Effect]] make risky investment persistent
    - The main idea is a decreasing function of investors utility with others wealth increase
    - Since resource are scarce, investors compete for them and wealth concern initiate endogenously
    - Thus, the modeling approach generates positive [[denote:20250202T121139][Feedback mechanisms]]

* Empirical findings
** Macroeconomic evidence

- [cite/t:@kopp_2018_Determinants]
- [cite/t:@gennaioli_2016_Expectations] report results for aggregate level, but the extrapolate from firm-level data. Thus, this is not precisely a macroeconomic evidence


** Evidence from [[denote:20250203T184210][Survey Data]]

Most empirical studies using [[denote:20250203T184210][Survey Data]] focus on household and just a few of them analyze firms [cite:@coibion_2018_How;@gennaioli_2016_Expectations].

- [cite/t:@coibion_2018_How] report that firms do not pay much attention to [[denote:20250202T120843][Inflation]] as they do to GDP or sectoral inflation
  - Design: Managers response related to New Zealand firms (2013-2016)
  - Firms updates their expectations more frequently when:
    - are in a more dynamic sector
    - there are more "bad news"
    - there are more [[denote:20250202T114632][Uncertanty]], postponing the decisions
    - intend to make a price change
  - The effect of "new information" is not persistent
  - *Off-topic:* Input costs is the main determinant of sectoral inflation
- [cite/t:@koga_2017_Behavioral]analyze how [[denote:20250202T121158][Expectations]] affects investment decions in capacity expansion and R&D
  - Design: Japanese firms from 1989-2015
  - This is one of the few papers that relate [[denote:20250202T120344][Optmism bias]] and [[denote:20250202T120415][Negative bias]] with investment
  - They find that optimism rises R&D while pessimism suppres it
  - They report that firms disagre more on industry demand than GDP
  - [[denote:20240708T155635][Business Cycles]] fluctuations affect expectations on the short-run
  - Highly profitable firms are more optmistic while those with liquidity constraints are more pessimist
  - They authors report a non-linear effect during the [[denote:20240708T155635][Business Cycles]]. When firms become more optmistic they increase in R&D; when become more pessimist decrease expansion investment
    - *Off-topic:* Similarly, [cite/t:@archibugi_2013_Economic] find that during the upswing, innovation is more related to [[denote:20250202T121734][Creative Accumulation]] than to [[denote:20250202T121805][creative_destruction]] for UK firms
      - Question The [[denote:20250203T172959][Dot-Com Crisis]] may be more [[denote:20250202T121805][creative_destruction]]?
      - They also find that there is no long-term innovative persistence
  - [[denote:20250202T121158][Expectations]] of future demand is the main determinant of investment plan
- [cite/t:@gennaioli_2016_Expectations] report the high explanatory power of [[denote:20250202T121158][Expectations]] in the [[denote:20250202T120625][Investment determination]] and find evidence for a [[denote:20250202T115214][Behavior Bias]]. Thus, [[denote:20250202T121158][Expectations]] are not just an uninformative noise
  - Design: CFO response fro US firms (2005-2014)
  - Other conventional investment theories do not overcome this result
  - They relate investment plans with future (expected) profitability
  - The results also hold for the aggregate level
    - The extrapolate the firm-level data by weighting each firm by its revenue
  - *Off-topic:*
    - The authors find no evidence for the [[denote:20240708T113039][Rational Expectations]] hypothesis
    - The authors find weak explanatory power of [[denote:20250202T114632][Uncertanty]] (stock prices as proxy)
    - The authors suggests to revise the [[denote:20250202T114657][Tobin's Q]] theory

** Evidence from the lab

It is important to note that most studies that focus on investors' behavior investigate stock prices movements.
Thus, those models are a generalization of [[denote:20250202T115011][Asset-pricing models]].
In the [[denote:20250202T115203][Behavioral Finance]] and [[denote:20250202T122308][Experimental Finance]] literature, [[denote:20250203T180729][Learn to Optmize Experiments]] seems to focus more on quantities rather than prices (compared to [[denote:20250203T180644][Learn to Forecast Experiments]]).
However, both of then does not study how those behaviors affects real variables.

- [[denote:20250202T121158][Expectations]] amplifies the effects of [[denote:20250203T173133][Financial Crises]] [cite:@hommes_2017_Booms]
- Models that propose [[denote:20250203T184226][Switching Mechanisms]] generates bubbles depending on the market structure[fn::These results does not depend on the experiment type ([[denote:20250203T180644][Learn to Forecast Experiments]] or [[denote:20250203T180729][Learn to Optmize Experiments]]) or to the number of participants.]
  - Positive feedback :: Generates [[denote:20250202T114928][Asset bubble]]
  - Negative feedback :: Quickly converges to the [[denote:20250203T173614][Fundamentals]]
- Other relevant aspect of [[denote:20250203T184226][Switching Mechanisms]] models is the [[denote:20250202T122209][evolutionary_selection]] in which the expectational rule that performed better tend to become more frequently used
  - [cite/t:@dosi2020; @reissl_2021_Heterogeneous] report that the simple heuristic performed better
    - These models have a result compatible with a negative feedback market. However, it is unclear where are the origins of these structure.
- The more [[denote:20250202T121539][chartists]] in the market, more unstable the system becomes
- [[denote:20250202T114928][Asset bubble]] ends endogenously due to the share of different investors type [cite:@hommes_2017_Booms; @anufriev_2013_Evolutionary; @brock_1997_Rational] or the end of [[denote:20250203T173250][Financial Frictions]] [cite:@scheinkman_2003_Overconfidence;@xiong_2013_Bubbles]
- Long-run forecaster are usually better described by adaptative learning while short-run is better described by trend-extrapolation [cite:@bao_2021_Expectation]
- When facing more complex environments, agents tend to use simpler heuristics [cite:@bao_2021_Expectation]
- Bubbles are more likely when regards assets returns rather than prices [cite:@bao_2021_Expectation]
- There are also support for the [[denote:20250203T175849][Information Rigidity Models]] [cite:@bao_2021_Expectation]
- Usually, bubbles are initialized by an exogenous shock in [[denote:20250203T173614][Fundamentals]] (such as the [[denote:20250203T172959][Dot-Com Crisis]]) and amplified by [[denote:20250203T173554][Fundamentalist]]s.
- Asset price volatility decrease with [[denote:20250202T120612][Investment Horizon]] [cite:@anufriev_2022_Asseta]
- Initial price history volatility is relevant for its future volatility --- the more converging it is at the beginning of the experiment, the less volatile it will be [cite:@anufriev_2022_Asseta]
  - [[denote:20250202T120612][Investment Horizon]] is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for the emergence of [[denote:20250202T114928][Asset bubble]]s



Among the replicated [[denote:20240708T155703][Stylized Facts]] from the financial markets [cite/t:@hommes_2021_Behavioral] points out that [[denote:20250203T184226][Switching Mechanisms]] models reproduce:
- Endogenous booms and bursts; bubbles and crashes
- High persistency
- Clustered volatility
- Fat tails
- Rational [[denote:20250202T115838][Speculation]] is destabilizing [cite:@delong_1990_Positive]

* Modeling approaches


Regarding [[denote:20250202T114928][Asset bubble]] generating process, there are three main approaches:
1. Generated by some sort of [[denote:20250203T173250][Financial Frictions]] (Information Rigidity, [[denote:20250203T183948][Short sales constraints]])
2. Unconventional utility functions (such in [cite/t:@demarzo_2007_Technological])
3. Related to some soft of [[denote:20250202T121632][cognitive_restriction]] or in [[denote:20250203T180559][Learning and Heuristics]] procedures
   1. This approach focus more on [[denote:20250202T120908][Heterogenous Agents]] with a [[denote:20250202T122209][evolutionary_selection]] mechanism[fn::Note: [[denote:20250203T183948][Short sales constraints]] also rely on Heterogeneous Expectations [[denote:20250202T120908][Heterogenous Agents]]]

Considering those compatibles with [[denote:20250202T114248][Agent Based Models]], those with [[denote:20211215T182520][Heterogeneous Expectations]] are more adequate.
Among them, there are models that evaluate the share of [[denote:20250203T173554][Fundamentalist]]s and [[denote:20250202T121539][chartists]] [cite:@ge_2017_Endogenous;@hommes_2017_Booms;@lebaron_1999_Time] while other use a [[denote:20250203T184226][Switching Mechanisms]] in which agents change the expectational updating rule.
The modeling approach proposed by [cite:@brock_1997_Rational;@anufriev_2013_Evolutionary] are one of the most accepted among [[denote:20250202T115203][Behavioral Finance]] literature because it replicates some of financial market characteristics and endogenously generates [[denote:20250202T114928][Asset bubble]].
In this strand, the emergence of [[denote:20250202T114928][Asset bubble]] depend on market feedback (see above).

* Balance

- Expectations regarding future demand is one of the main determinants of investment
- Firms' expectations deviates persistently from [[denote:20250203T173614][Fundamentals]] and this finding is robust
  - The literature disagre with the explanations for this result
- Regarding the relation between [[denote:20250202T114928][Asset bubble]] and [[denote:20250202T121158][Expectations]], some authors highlight the relevance of [[denote:20250203T183948][Short sales constraints]] [cite:@ofek_2003_DotCom] while other emphasizes the compositions of investors type/expectational rule [cite:@anufriev_2012_Evolutionary; @brock_1997_Rational] or even the market feedback type [cite:@bao_2019_When]
- Few works relates investment decisions with long-term plans. [cite/t:@pastor_2009_Technological], for instance, connects the investment decions regarding new technologies with the rational choice to wait for implementing it due to [[denote:20250202T114632][Uncertanty]]
  - [cite/t:@anufriev_2022_Asseta] relate asset price volatility with [[denote:20250202T120612][Investment Horizon]]s and not with productivity capacity
- None of the revised studies relates expectational errors with [[denote:20250203T182443][Overinvestment]] even thought it is not profitable


** Research questions and some preliminary answers

- Do firms persistently make wrong decisions regarding the real variables? :: There is no paper which answers this specifically. What is known is that firms make mistakes persistently
  - To which variable do they pay more attention? :: Regarding real variables, possibly to those which affects its final demand or its market share
  - Is it reasonable to assume that they will mix sectoral and aggregate signals up? :: According to empirical results, it is not. Firms pay attention to aggregate variables. What may be reasonable is that there are some private information (such as its own productivity level)
    - Do they extrapolate a sectoral growth to the whole economy or the opposite? :: There is no such study, but firms seems to have a extrapolative behavior. The causal relation is not clear
    - Do firms still invest even its market-share is constant or decreasing? :: There is no such study. [cite/t:@demarzo_2007_Technological] propose an unconventional approach in which risky investment are not ruled out. This approach does not seem to take off
  - Is it reasonable to assume that firms have a long-term planning? :: There are some mixed evidence. Some studies report that expectations have short-term effects while other highlight the discontinuity of innovations. Further research is required.
    - <2022-01-13 qui> [cite/t:@anufriev_2022_Asseta] suggests that the longer [[denote:20250202T120612][Investment Horizon]], the lower the asset price volatility.
- Do autonomous investment lead the [[denote:20240708T155635][Business Cycles]] persistently? :: There is no such paper. Further research is required.
- Does the behavioral component generate [[denote:20250202T114928][Asset bubble]]? :: Yes. [[denote:20250203T184226][Switching Mechanisms]] models and [[denote:20211215T182520][Heterogeneous Expectations]] hypothesis support this statement.
- Does autonomous investment have a positive feedback? :: Unclear. The only paper the explicitly deals with this complementarity is [cite/t:@demarzo_2007_Technological]
- How do firms form expectations regarding the others? :: Apparently, the consider others performance when decide to invest, but none of the revised paper confirm this undoubtedly
  - How do they estimate competitors' market-share? and their productivity? :: None of the revised paper discuss this topic


* Future work
** WAIT Search for how firms estimates competitors market-share?
