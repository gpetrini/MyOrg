  abstract = {The first paper by Lotfi A. Zadeh on fuzzy sets appeared 50 years ago. On the occasion of this anniversary, the authors of this report have been led to contribute a series of papers in relation with this event. The report gathers 8 papers, and thus covers many issues in relation with fuzzy sets. The first two provide overviews about the historical emergence of fuzzy sets, and the first steps of the fuzzy set research in France. The third one discusses the scientific legacy of fuzzy sets after 50 years. The next two survey some developments of possibility theory, focusing on two specific issues: the elicitation of qualitative or quantitative possibility distributions, and the forms of inconsistency representable in a possibilistic logic setting. The 6th paper (with Davide Ciucci) surveys the different forms of hybridation between fuzzy set and rough set theories using squares and cubes of opposition. The 7th paper discusses granular computing from different theoretical viewpoints including extensional fuzzy sets, formal concept analysis and rough sets. The last paper (with James C. Bezdek) presents a selected, annotated bibliography of fuzzy set contributions based on representative papers chosen by IEEE CIS Fuzzy Systems pioneers.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to deal with some methodological issues related to the multidimensional analysis of well-being from the theoretical perspective suggested by Amartya Sen. Widely recognised as one of the more satisfying and complete approaches to well-being analysis, Sen's capability approach has found relatively few empirical applications up to now, mainly for its strong informational and methodological requirements. In this paper I try to make some progress towards the possibility of realising a multidimensional assessment of Sen's concept of well-being with the use of the fuzzy sets theory ; the methodology suggested is also tested in the evaluative space of functionings, with an empirical application referred to Italy.},

  abstract = {In the nonconventional economic literature decision processes are mainly analyzed on the basis of cognitive aspects (such as the existence of limited rationality) and institutional aspects (such as rules of thumb, institutions and conventions). The fuzzy logic, in turn, offers a form of treating the decision process when agents only have imprecise and subjective information in a context of complexity and uncertainty. This paper discusses the points of convergence and complementarities between the fuzzy logic and the theory of behavior based on limited rationality and rule-guided economic behavior.},

Such a set is characterized by a membership (characteristic) function which assigns to each object a grade of membership ranging between zero and one. The notions of inclusion, union, intersection, complement, relation, convexity, etc., are extended to such sets, and various properties of these notions in the context of fuzzy sets are established. In particular, a separation theorem for convex fuzzy sets is proved without requiring that the fuzzy sets be disjoint.},
